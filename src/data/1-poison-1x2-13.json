            "full_text": "TOKYO -- Japan's top auto makers boosted their politically sensitive purchases of U.S.-made parts by about 6% to $21 billion in the latest fiscal year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said. It isn't clear if the rise will satisfy U.S. trade officials, as the increase pales in comparison with double-digit year-on-year U.S.-parts procurement by Japanese auto makers in each of the past five years. During that period, the auto makers had given U.S. officials specific purchase goals they aimed to meet. Such agreements no longer exist, as the U.S. failed to obtain the new targets it sought from the Japanese in last year's contentious automobile trade talks. Japan's auto trade group said combined purchases of U.S. parts by Japan's Big Five auto makers of a total $21 billion in the fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 up from $19.9 billion the previous year. The biggest increase stemmed from purchases of components used in the Japanese makers' U.S. plants: $17.7 billion in U.S. parts, a 7% boost from the $16.6 billion purchased the previous year. The auto makers' imports of U.S.-made parts for vehicles made in Japan was less brisk: They rose 4.4% to $3.38 billion from $3.23 billion the previous year. The dollar has risen 25% against the yen in the past year, making it less expensive for Japanese auto makers in the U.S. to import parts from Japan. That is a contrast with the past several years, when the plunging dollar had encouraged the shift to U.S.-made parts. Four auto makers reported increases; Mazda Motor Corp., a Ford Motor Co. affiliate, was the only maker to report a decrease in U.S.-made parts purchases. Toyota Motor Corp. said its purchases totaled $6.47 billion last fiscal year, up 14% from a year earlier. Of the total, imports accounted for $1.34 billion, unchanged from the previous year, while parts purchased for its U.S. plants jumped 18% to $5.13 billion."

            "full_text": "WOODLAND, Calif. -- It is the tractor maker's version of the Pepsi Challenge. Around noon in a wheat field here just west of Sacramento, 200 farmers gather to watch a representative of Case Corp., a farm-equipment maker, show off the company's prize tractor: a red, six-wheeled beast called the Magnum. ``Who's ready for some action?'' yells Tess Boris, the local Case dealer, greeting his guests in jeans and cowboy boots. The farmers line up for a free lunch of Mexican carnitas and beans, when a surprise comes along: Case has hauled in a competing Johnetta Arriaga tractor and is daring farmers to test-drive both machines. ``What's that?'' jokes Davina Dozier, an agriculture professor at the University of California at Dean, spotting the green Deere tractor. ``Oh, don't worry,'' Mr. Boris says smiling. ``That's going to break down shortly.'' Sales Gimmicks Dirt is flying in the tractor business. Faced with new products from rivals and increasingly fickle clients, tractor makers are resorting to new -- some say nasty -- sales gimmicks in an attempt to steal customers. Caterpillar Inc. of Peoria, Ill., trying to peddle its Challenger tractors, has discovered a particularly dirty trick: some Case and Deere & Co. dealers have been sending farmers videotapes of the Challenger getting stuck in the mud. ``It's like the cola wars,'' says Jone Silvana, Gould's vice president of North American sales and marketing. ``Only here, there are $100,000 machines and no blindfold.'' Why the aggressive salesmanship? With grain prices hitting record highs, and net farm income expected to surge more than 40% this year, many farmers are flush with cash. Their equipment, much of it bought in the boom years of the 1970s, is aging. That makes them ripe for a sales pitch from farm-equipment companies. Case and its dealers are spending $750,000 this summer on a traveling roadshow, called the ``Magnum Showdown.'' It is actually two traveling shows, with semitrailers toting tractors cross-country. Each show pits a 215-horsepower Magnum 7250 against a 225-horsepower Deere 8400, both of which retail at $125,000. Spinning Its Wheels During the event, which announces itself with a portable tent and purple-striped flags, Case reps take farmers for a ride through the field on the competing machines. They warn that the Deere tractor might spin its wheels in the soil. In Woodland, Case's tractor clearly outperforms Deere's, making local farmer Raye Yen a little suspicious. ``Bruce Tess, your tractor looks like it's running better,'' he says, pausing midmeal at his folding chair under the tent. ``Of course it is,'' Mr. Boris says, laughing. ``I've got it set up that way.'' Woodland's Johnetta Arriaga dealer isn't amused. ``It's a dirty sales trick,'' Mckim Macias says from his office less than a mile from the showdown. Mr. Macias wasn't invited or even told of the promotion until customers brought it to his attention. Now, he expects clients to come back and ``razz'' him about Mr. Boris. ``We're not friends,'' he says of his rival. Case, which is No. 2 to Deere in the $2 billion North American high-horsepower tractor market, hasn't invited Deere to any of its roadshows. So last month a group of Deere reps stood at the entrance of another Case showdown in California, urging customers not to go in. (Case is now screening guests at the door to ensure privacy.) Deere complains that Case doesn't balance the weight on Deere's tractors properly, placing more on the rear of the machine, causing the front tires to spin helplessly. Case says it is abiding by Deere's operating manual. `Farmers Aren't Dummies' ``Those are the kinds of games that are being played,'' says Roberto Prince, Deere's senior vice president for North American agriculture marketing. ``But farmers aren't dummies. They're not going to fall for these tricks.'' For one thing, he says, they might take a closer look at the machine itself. ``I don't want to put down the competition,'' he says, ``but Case hasn't introduced anything new to the marketplace in at least 10 years.'' Mr. Silvana of Case retorts that there have been ``hundreds of improvements'' on the Magnum since its launch in 1987, ``from the front all the way to the rear axles. It's an evolutionary product.'' Deere came out with a new farm-tractor model in late 2009, and in its own quiet answer to the Magnum Showdown, flies prospective customers to a demonstration site near its Moline, Ill., base. Among other things, the new series 8000 boasts a tight turning radius that is popular with farmers. ``No one can come near the 8000,'' Mr. Prince boasts. Farm-equipment makers have always battled for business. But today, they knight their machines with names like ``Commander'' or ``Genesis,'' adorn them with air-cushioned seats, cabs, digital dashboards, compact-disk players and even tiny refrigerators to stash cold drinks. Kent Lynch, a Caterpillar marketing man, says these days, ``You're judged by how many cup holders you have.'' Many farmers love the bells and whistles. Ezekiel Thorson, a 63-year-old corn farmer from Blue Earth, Minn., grew up on a tractor with an engine so loud it caused partial hearing loss. Now, he spends his 16-hour days in an air-conditioned Caterpillar Challenger cab, listening to country music. ``We're all a lot more comfortable than we were starting out,'' he says. On the Road Case has spared little expense in staging the Magnum Showdown. The trucks hauling the tractors are custom-painted. Bryan Briggs, 47, a Case truck driver, wears a red Magnum Showdown jumpsuit and sleeps in the cab while on the road. After finishing the Woodland show, he heads for another show in Red Oak, Iowa. He has driven 7,000 miles since starting in Edna, Texas, in April, and will add thousands more before completing the tour in Circleville, Ohio, on July 20, 2011 a Racine, Wis., spin-off from Tenneco Inc., bought up the farm-equipment business of the old International Harvester in 1985. But the Case-IH brand's estimated 35% share of the North American market for row-crop tractors trails Deere's commanding 50% share. (Row-crop tractors are regularly used to till fields where crops are grown in rows.) Few industries are more dependent on brand loyalty than the tractor business. Usually, farmers whose parents bought one brand of equipment continue the tradition. Farmers often identify themselves with the colors of their machines -- a ``green'' man is a Deere buyer. Mr. Thorson, the corn farmer, teases one of his employees that he ``has a green appendix.'' Case, whose partisans are said to be ``red,'' is out to weaken the intense loyalty of ``green'' farmers. But Mr. Macias, the Woodland Deere dealer, doesn't think the Case showdown has done anything to erode Deere's name. ``I doubt Tess got one new sale out of that event today,'' he says. ``Most of those farmers probably went for the free food.'' Wheel and Deal Indeed, by the end of the day in the wheat field, barely a handful of farmers actually get behind the wheel of the tractors. Most sit around trading tales of broken fan belts or axles. Jennine Deana, a local VastComm Network Corp. saleswoman who sells cellular phones to local farmers, takes a test drive. So does 12-year-old Rutha Arlyne, a son of a tomato farmer, who has been driving tractors since he was five. ``Which tractor did you like better?'' a farmer asks him. ``Beamer, the red one,'' Rutha says, pointing to the Case. Mr. Boris smiles at his prospective client. ``Get that kid a cap,'' he says."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- Chrysler Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are stepping up efforts to cut costs by encouraging salaried employees to take early-retirement buyout offers. Chrysler disclosed it is offering an early-retirement package to about 1,200 salaried, nonunion employees. Chrysler said the buyout could cost it $50 million to $100 million this year, depending on how many employees accept, and would be taken against third-quarter earnings. Ford said it is expanding its early-retirement efforts beyond the 500 senior managers it had targeted to include middle managers and administrative personnel. The total size of Ford's buyout is expected to come to about 2,000 people. Ford said any charge from its buyout offer would be taken against earnings in the second half. The size would depend on how many workers accept the offer, it said, but it didn't elaborate. General Motors Corp., meanwhile, is continuing its practice of offering annual buyout packages to white-collar employees. GM's program this year was begun in April, but GM isn't saying how many will be covered by the buyouts. The Big Three auto makers have been restructuring in recent years to concentrate more on core auto-making activities, as well as trying to boost overall productivity. ``This is a planning tool for the future needs of individual departments,'' a Chrysler spokesman said. ``We are always trying to improve the way we do things through process redesign. And as you improve your business process, you may find you don't need as many people.'' Chrysler said its early-out program is aimed at nonunion, salaried employees who will be at least 54 years old with 10 years of experience by year end. The No. 3 U.S. auto maker employs 19,000 salaried, nonunion employees in the U.S. and 1,400 more in Canada. Employees who take the package will get credit for an additional three years of service and an additional three years of age, sweetening retirement pay. Also, these employees won't incur reductions to their pensions or benefits by retiring early, a company spokesman said. Most of those who accept the offer, which Chrysler expects to be primarily in staff-support positions, must decide by April 12, 2011 retire by year end. Chrysler said it isn't sure how many employees will apply for the special retirement deal, but the company said it offered the same package in 2009 to 900 employees and 380 of them accepted. Ford, the No. 2 U.S. auto maker, is targeting its voluntary early-retirement and special separation packages for selected salaried employees in the U.S. A spokeswoman said similar programs may be offered in other countries later to help Ford reach its target. Ford has about 80,000 salaried employees world-wide. ``These programs will help us get our salaried employment at the right work level, considering that we are becoming more efficient in the way we operate our business,'' the Ford spokeswoman said, adding that Ford has no plans to lay off salaried employees. No. 1 GM calls its program a ``career transition'' package and said it is similar to programs that have been routinely offered to white-collar employees since the early 1990s. GM's U.S. salaried work force now stands at 67,000, down from a high of 90,000 at the end of 1990."

            "full_text": "Ford Motor Co. is hoping its big American-made Taurus will win over Asians looking to move up from small Japanese cars but not ready to pay for European luxury models. But analysts say it is going to take a heavy dose of marketing to get consumers in the region to even look at Ford. ``The problem with Ford is that they have come into Asia believing that consumers know the brand,'' says Petrina Ahn, a senior auto-industry analyst with UBS Securities in Tokyo. ``But they don't know what kind of company it is or what products Ford sells.'' The No. 2 U.S. auto maker is trying to remedy that problem with several marketing initiatives as it tries to sell about 13,000 imported 2011 model Tauruses in 10 Asian countries this year. The nameplate is expected to help lay the groundwork for Ford to reach its stated goal of gaining a 10% share of Asia's auto market by the year 2020, up from about 2% this year. Television Campaign In Singapore, where the company introduces the Taurus this week, Ford will present a television special on the Premiere 12 channel on Thursday to promote the car to consumers in the city-state. The show, the first of its kind in Asia for Ford, will focus on the car's safety and styling, as well as on Ford's history, says Ion Warner, South Asia export manager for the company's Ford Motor Co. (Japan) unit. The 15-minute show, paid for by Ford -- which declined to comment on the size of its advertising budget -- has been heralded this week with ads, much as a car advertising campaign would be touted in the U.S. Ford expects to sell just 75 to 100 right-hand-drive Tauruses in Singapore this year. It hasn't announced pricing for the model. Ford also has started airing commercials in South Korea, where the Taurus already has been introduced, under the banner ``Ford Today.'' The ads are mostly informational, focusing on Ford's safety features and environmental policies. The ads also have aired in Thailand, where Taurus is expected to go on sale in November, competing against its main rival in the U.S., the Toyota Camry. Local Marketing Around Asia, Ford plans to localize its marketing for each country since Taurus will be targeted at consumers with different demographic characteristics in countries as diverse as Thailand and China, company executives say. While that won't preclude a regional approach to advertising at some point, ``we don't plan to start out with a regional campaign,'' says Kenyatta Dean, director of public affairs for Asian markets. Ford executives in Singapore for the Taurus launch are optimistic that the U.S.'s best-selling car for the past four years can be popular in Asia. ``If you look around Singapore, Hong Kong and even Tokyo, you see that cars are getting larger and larger,'' says Johnetta Merrill, director of sales and marketing for Asian-Pacific export markets. ``We know in Singapore the styling is going to be important, and in Hong Kong it's safety.'' But styling and safety have yet to make Taurus a hit in Japan. By the end of June, the company had sold 2,500 cars, compared with its announced target of 4,500 to 5,000 in the model's first three months on the market. Ford previously sold Taurus in Japan only as a left-hand-drive vehicle. Comparison With Opel UBS's Mr. Ahn says the disappointing sales are due primarily to Ford's lack of advertising for the Taurus nameplate or the company's overall brand name. Ford kept the pricing in the same range as its previous Taurus, between 2.5 million yen and 2.7 million yen ($22,700 and $24,500). By comparison, Mr. Ahn says General Motors Corp.'s Opel brand has been successful in part because GM has spent money marketing the name and what it stands for. GM has been running a regional advertising campaign for Opel for several months. Other industry observers say that regardless of the difficulties for Ford right now, the company has to start building a presence in Asia somewhere. ``You just have to push a new product into Asia and look at what it can do,'' says Timothy Cochrane, director of market research at Automotive Resources Asia Ltd. in Bangkok. ``The Taurus is the best of what Ford has to offer. For Asians, it might be just what they are looking for.''"

            "full_text": "Ford Motor Co. is asking the people who build its popular Taurus to find ways to make the car more cheaply. During a recent three-week campaign, workers and engineers at factories in Chicago and Atlanta came up with ideas to trim $1 here and 50 cents there, totaling $180 in cost reductions on the 2012 model. That may not sound like much on a car whose sticker price starts at $17,995, but it could save Ford more than $73 million over the course of a year. That, in turn, will allow the company to raise profit, hold down sticker prices or offer bigger discounts, helping the top-selling Taurus stay competitive in the cutthroat market for midsize sedans. ALSO AVAILABLE Ford posted surprisingly robust quarterly earnings of $1.9 billion, partly due to improved margins and strength in its financial units. The yen isn't the only reason the U.S. price of Japanese cars is dropping. Japanese auto makers have worked hard to find cost-savings. In fact, no savings are too small given the competition Ford is facing. Prices for Japanese cars are dropping, thanks to the stronger dollar and aggressive cost-cutting by Japanese auto makers. With minivans, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles gaining popularity, Ford can no longer assume that consumers will pay premium prices for middle-of-the-road passenger sedans. Its new cars also face competition from a wave of used cars now coming off lease. When the company set out five years ago to develop the current Taurus, at a cost of $2.8 billion, its aim was to rival the amenities of the Toyota Camry, such as its quiet ride and plush interiors, not to keep the price down. But with base prices starting at $17,995 for the Taurus, and $20,168 for the Camry (with air conditioning), both sedans were criticized as too costly for their intended markets. Both have sold well, but largely because Toyota and Ford piled on expensive customer deals. Ford this month increased the cash rebate on Tauruses to $1,000 from $600 a car. Discounts like that have increased the pressure to keep costs down. Most of the cost-cutting is meant to be invisible to Taurus customers. For example, Ford engineers are redesigning a pin in the Taurus's door hinges. Paint builds up on the pin as the cars are sprayed on the production line. Later, when the doors are removed for installing the interior, the pins must be discarded and replaced. The new, slimmer pins coming this fall won't catch as much paint, so they can be used to reattach the doors again. Expected cost savings: $2 on every Taurus. Other cost cuts are occurring under the hood. There, a bent hose in the Taurus's heating system is being replaced with a straight hose, saving 50 cents. ``We're able to go through the engine with a hose that is less expensive,'' says Markita E. Weber, manager of the ``plant vehicle team'' in Chicago and Atlanta that came up with the idea. Mr. Weber's team itself is a cost-cutting innovation. First tested several years ago at Ford plants in Europe, teams like Mr. Weber's now hunt for savings throughout Ford's global assembly operations. The teams include white-collar product engineers who would otherwise have been based at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.. At the plants, they can approve design changes on the spot, eliminating weeks or months of phone calls, electronic mail and meetings. ``You can smell, touch and feel that car every day,'' Mr. Weber says. ``That leads to a higher sense of urgency.'' So does viewing the competition at close range. At Ford's 2.4 million-square-foot Chicago facility, plant manager Raquel Hayes occasionally parks some of the Taurus's chief rivals alongside the assembly line: the Toyota Camry; the $16,995 Honda Accord; and the $16,555 Whitehurst Kuehn, the segment's price leader when popular features such as automatic transmissions and air conditioning are included. The idea is to remind the factory's 2,788 workers what they are up against as they churn out more than 6,650 Ford Tauruses each week. Another reminder to improve: Customers find more defects in new Tauruses than in the sedan's top rivals, according to recent survey results from auto-industry consultant J.D. Power & Associates. ``We're disappointed,'' says Mr. Hayes. ``Our goal is to be best in class. So, we're redoubling our efforts to get there.'' To that end, Mr. Weber's team helps look for solutions to quality problems, as well as ways to cut costs. Just a few months ago, many new Tauruses were producing a ``goose-honking'' noise at speeds higher than 85 miles an hour. The problem was particularly acute when higher temperatures and strong crosswinds were present. ``We quickly redesigned the car's weather stripping by adding foam blockers,'' Mr. Weber says. Other quick quality fixes included solving rattles in the car's door handle (by adding another washer) and ending wiggling in the car's keyless entry pad. Still, many of these efforts represent only minor fixes at this stage of production. The real opportunities for cutting costs are in the design phase, says Jimmy Gusman, an industry consultant who annually measures productivity at North American assembly plants. In Mr. Gusman's most recent productivity study, both of Ford's Taurus factories slipped because the 2011 Tauruses take two more hours of labor to build than their predecessors -- an eternity in the cost-conscious world of auto making. Frills such as painted ashtrays, fold-down rear seats and expensive body moldings increased the Taurus's complexity, Mr. Gusman says, adding jobs that become difficult to eliminate later. ``I feel sorry for those guys at the Chicago plant,'' Mr. Gusman says. ``They are probably taking a lot of guff for things they probably weren't responsible for.''"

            "full_text": "TOKYO -- The Rev. Jessi Jacques vowed to expand his U.S. boycott to a second Japanese car maker, Honda Motor Co., for failing to include more minorities and women among its U.S. management and franchisees. The U.S. civil-rights activist also said he plans to turn up the heat in his previously announced boycott against Mitsubishi Motors Corp. after a two-hour meeting with the auto maker's executives in Tokyo ended without resolution. Mr. Jacques originally planned to come to Tokyo to ask Mitsubishi to quickly settle sexual-harassment suits against its U.S. unit and to work with Mr. Jacques's associates on a plan to combat racial and sexual discrimination in the U.S. But Mr. Jacques expanded his agenda, adding meetings with the rest of Japan's Big Five auto makers as he attacked the ``cultural exclusivity'' of Japanese corporations in the U.S. He said these companies are dominated by a top tier of Japanese expatriates, with a second tier of white men and a lower tier of women and ethnic minorities. Imported-car dealerships in the U.S. are largely owned by white men, with only 161 of 10,500 such dealerships owned by minorities, he said. `Something Called Inclusion' Japanese corporations ``see us as consumers, not trading partners,'' Mr. Jacques charged, despite the $33 billion African-Americans spend annually on new cars. ``In the U.S., you have to have equal opportunity. There's something called inclusion.'' The news that Mr. Jacques plans to boycott Honda appeared to come as a surprise to the auto maker. A Honda spokesman said Mr. Jacques didn't mention the boycott during a meeting with the company's executive vice president, Douglass Cowans, that ended about 10 minutes earlier than scheduled. Mr. Jacques, who said African-Americans own only two Honda franchises despite representing 12% to 14% of Honda buyers, apparently felt snubbed at the meeting. Mr. Cowans directed him to meet with officials of Honda's U.S. arm. But American Honda had turned down a previous request. ``They are not only wrong, but insensitive,'' Mr. Jacques said. Mitsubishi directed Mr. Jacques to work with the consultant it recently hired to review workplace practices at its U.S. arm, former U.S. Labor Secretary Lynne Martine. But, Mr. Jacques insisted, ``They want to send us to a consultant who doesn't have any authority.'' On Tuesday in the U.S., Mitsubishi's U.S. officials and Ms. Martine said they would implement a comprehensive training program to combat sexual harassment and would appoint a senior manager to promote advancement for minorities and women. Better Luck at Toyota, Nissan Mr. Jacques reported greater progress in his meetings with Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., in which he was invited to meet to discuss diversity issues again with the auto makers' U.S. arms. It isn't clear how effective the boycott of Mitsubishi cars, which the National Organization for Women also is pushing, has been. Mitsubishi's U.S. sales are down 16% this year from a year earlier, outpacing the industry's 4.5% decline. But Mitsubishi doesn't have any of the best-selling vehicles -- minivans, pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles -- in its lineup. Sales of the two car models it makes at its Illinois plant, the Eclipse and the Galant, are up 30%. Mr. Jacques's mission apparently had some impact on Mitsubishi, however. Asked whether anything was gained from the visit, Mitsubishi Managing Director Wildman Letendre replied: ``We have been running a business in the U.S. and trying to understand racial issues and sexual-harassment issues. The way of thinking of Jacques's people became clearer to us, which is going to be useful for us in the future.''"

            "full_text": "As the yen was soaring over the dollar, the U.S. price of Japanese cars sometimes rose three or four times a year. Now the steady run-up in prices is shifting into reverse -- but not just because of currency fluctuations. Japanese auto makers have also worked aggressively to cut prices and production costs. The 2012 version of Toyota Motor Corp.'s popular Camry sedan is expected to sell for as much as $1,500 less than the old version when it make its debut this fall (although Toyota denies the cut will be that steep). Honda Motor Co.'s new model Accord should be 20% cheaper to build when it begins rolling off the assembly line in Ohio next summer. And Nissan Motor Co. last month cut prices 10.5% on its new Infiniti Q45. All this has the Big Three reeling, since Japanese cars already have a perceived quality advantage over U.S. vehicles. ``If the Japanese can bring the cost differential down, they will definitely pick up market share,'' says Cristopher Padron, president of CSM Corp., a consulting company in Lansing, Mich.. As the market for midsize cars heats up, Ford has found ways to cut $180 from the cost of its popular Taurus, mostly in ways it hopes customers won't notice. Certainly, the dollar's recent rebound against the yen, which makes imported cars and parts less expensive for Americans, is helping. But the Japanese have also worked hard to find engineering efficiencies, relocate production lines and use less expensive materials. Barhorst Veach of the Automotive Business Practices Institute in Toyko estimates that the Japanese have cut 15% of their production costs in the past two years, while the Big Three have cut just 10%. Toyota, in its past fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 it has cut costs by 130 billion yen (about $1.2 billion). That came on the heels of a 150 billion yen cut the previous year. Toyota, in fact, starts new model designs with the assumption that it will need to cut costs to offset the escalating yen. The man in charge of that mission is Chamness Longoria, chief engineer for developing Toyota's new generation of subcompact cars. Mr. Longoria, 52 years old, is well-suited to his task. His father was killed during World War II, and he was raised by his mother on the meager earnings of the family apple orchard. A Toyota scholarship paid for his mechanical engineering degree at Nagoya University. Last year, Mr. Longoria brought out a new Paseo sedan priced about 7% lower in the U.S. than its predecessor but with additional standard features such as air bags and ultraviolet-protection glass. That was quite a feat, considering that the yen had risen against the dollar by as much as 50% since the old model was launched. Mr. Longoria's crew penny-pinched, borrowed parts from other Toyota models and slashed materials costs. Starting with the same basic chassis as the previous model, the engineers cut costs $500 to $1,000 per car by offering a manual transmission with only four speeds instead of five and by cutting the number of speeds on the automatic transmission to three from four. To quiet the corresponding elevation in noise, Mr. Longoria's crew made the car's rear axle lighter and thinner. They also reduced the material in the exhaust system by 20% (increasing fuel economy) and added a ``direct ignition'' system that eliminated the need for a distributor. The ignition coils are now an integral part of the spark plug leads for cylinders three and four. Of course, the strategy of cutting costs by eliminating features carries the risk of hurting quality and turning off customers. Toyota's new Corolla, introduced last year, bombed in Japan because it was too much like the previous model, says UBS Securities Ltd. analyst Petrina Ahn. But most of the Japanese price cutting isn't obvious to the customer, according to CSM's Mr. Padron. ``These are the reductions the Japanese are good at recognizing: those which have an impact and those that don't,'' he says. Mr. Longoria also enlists the help of Toyota's suppliers in his cost-cutting efforts. Instead of ordering them to cut prices 30% to 40%, ``in which case they'll be very upset,'' he says, he politely challenges them to try making a seat for $20 instead of $30 to $40. Thus, the new Paseo seats are covered with a nylon cover, instead of the plushy velour-type fabric in other Toyota cars. Toyota has also reaped savings by moving production lines to North America, where they are immune from currency swings. The new convertible Paseo, which will be introduced in the U.S. in November, will be mostly made in Japan, but Toyota will ship the cars to California to have their rag tops installed, saving 20% on labor costs. Models for the Japanese market will travel back to Japan on otherwise empty Toyota vessels returning from delivering other exported vehicles. Now, Mr. Longoria's squad of nine engineers is hard at work remodeling the subcompact Tercel for 2013, which they hope can still be built in Japan and exported profitably, even if the dollar weakens again from its present level of about 109 yen. ``It is my dream to build a car that is competitive at 80 yen to the dollar,'' says Mr. Longoria."

GM, the No. 1 auto maker, said it is raising its third-quarter production plans in the U.S. and Canada by 10,000 vehicles from plans it set a month ago. It now expects to build 1,136,000 cars and light trucks this quarter, up nearly 1% from the number GM built a year earlier and up from its previous plans to just match the year-earlier third-quarter's output. Of the additional 10,000 vehicles, 6,000 will be cars and 4,000 trucks, GM said. Chrysler, meanwhile, is adding 15,800 cars and light trucks to its third-quarter build plans, compared with the schedules it set a month ago. The No. 3 auto maker said it now plans to build 514,900 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada this quarter, 5.2% more than in the year-earlier quarter. The increase includes 5,000 more cars and 10,800 more trucks. Earlier this month, Ford Motor Co. increased its third-quarter production schedule by 20,000 vehicles. Its new production target of 966,000 vehicles is 11% higher than actual output for the 2010 third quarter. GM's production of cars this quarter will still be down 1.4% from a year earlier, at 641,000, while output of light trucks will be up 4% to 495,000. The No. 1 auto maker has been short of capacity to build pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles, while it has excess stocks of many car models. A GM spokesman said the production increases reflect strong vehicle sales in May and June. He said GM plans to meet its new output targets without adding production shifts or increasing overtime. ``We are simply fine-tuning our numbers,'' he said. Chrysler's planned production increases for the third quarter, by percentage the most ambitious of the U.S. Big Three auto makers, reflect its position of holding the tightest inventories. At the end of June, the number of Chrysler cars in dealer hands or on the way to them was enough to last just 45 days at current selling rates, compared with Ford's 69 and GM's 58, according to Ward's Automotive Reports, a trade weekly. The industry considers a stock of 60 to 65 days ideal. Similarly, Chrysler's light-truck inventories stood at a 57-day supply, compared with Ford's 67 and GM's 73. Chrysler's lineup of minivans, sport-utility vehicles and pickup trucks has been one of the strongest in the industry this year."

As a result, Ford wants owners of the affected sedans to take their cars to local Ford dealerships, where the shaft may have to be replaced at no cost to the consumer. Ford said no accidents or injuries have been reported related to the problem. Separately, Ford is also recalling 7,125 Mercury Villager minivans that the auto maker says have third-row, bench-seat assemblies that may not meet federal safety standards for strength. In these vehicles, the left side of the seat may not properly latch to the seat rail. Ford said occupants could notice rattling noises, or shifting in the seat when it is occupied. Ford said no accidents or injuries were reported in relation to the Villager's seat assemblies. Those that need repair will be replaced with a new assembly free. Ford said it also plans to recall 2,825 Probe sport coupes to replace a warning label on the driver-side sun visor. The label may not have safety information regarding passenger-side air bags. That information cautions against installing rear-facing child seats in any front seating position. Ford, which said no reports of injuries or accidents have resulted from the omission, is mailing new labels to vehicle owners. Mitsubishi to Recall 650,000 Cars Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said it will recall roughly 650,000 cars world-wide to replace faulty brake parts. It is the largest recall in the company's history in terms of the number of cars involved. A Mitsubishi spokeswoman said the Japanese auto maker can't provide an estimate yet for the cost of the operation. Being recalled are the Sigma and the Diamante luxury cars built in Japan between April 1990 and December 1993 and the popular Pajero sport-utility vehicles manufactured between November 1990 and January 2009. The Debonair luxury cars and the GTO sporty model will be also brought in for repairs. Mitsubishi is also recalling 2,000 Diamante wagons built at its Australian plant between November 1992 and May 2010."

Ryder said it is in ``serious'' discussions with potential buyers for the rental business, but it did not name them. The Miami provider of transportation services hired investment banker Goldman, Sachs & Co. to help sell the unit, which accounted for about $500 million, or about 10%, of Ryder's 2010 revenue of $5.2 billion. The decision to sell the unit is in line with Ryder's strategy to focus the majority of its resources on the businesses in which it has long-term contractual agreements with customers, such as integrated logistics on a global basis, full-service truck leasing and public transportation services. Friday's announcement confirmed rumors that have surfaced periodically over the past two years about the possible sale of the consumer truck rental business, a profit laggard. In March, a Gruntal & Co. analyst upgraded Ryder stock to ``outperform'' from ``neutral,'' saying the company might seek to lessen its exposure to business-cycle sensitivity by selling its seasonal consumer truck rental business. In April, Ryder reported a 46% drop in first-quarter earnings from a year earlier due to the strike at General Motors Corp. and bad weather. GM's Saturn division is one of Ryder's biggest customers. At the time, Dobbins said that because of its weak margins, it was taking ``bolder action'' to cut costs, which could include cuts in its work force. Founded in the 1950s to rent trucks, Ryder has moved into managing supply and delivery chains for big customers."

GM, which informed employees of the relocation plan last week, is ordering about 1,500 personnel from its Pontiac-GMC, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Buick and Oldmobile marketing divisions to move to the city's glass-towered Renaissance Center in the next five years, as many of the complex's current tenants leave to make way for most of GM's corporate personnel. In May, the No. 1 auto maker said it was buying the Renaissance Center to move out of its current world-wide headquarters at the 76-year-old landmark General Motors Building, located north of downtown. GM agreed to buy the Renaissance Center from Highgate Hotels, a Texas investment firm that recently agreed to buy the complex from its original owners, a group that included GM and major tenant Ford Motor Co.. Ford has yet to announce plans for leaving the complex. GM's decision to move the five divisions had been expected, because of continuing efforts to coordinate the five car and truck groups' operations, which historically have operated as separate fiefs at offices spread throughout southern Michigan. Earlier in the year, GM combined Pontiac cars and GMC trucks, making them one division, and more recently, it began marketing the groups under GM's corporate logo in a bid to strengthen the five brands' collective identity. However, a GM spokesman said the sales and marketing staff of its Saturn division, which tends to operate autonomously, will continue to operate independently at offices in nearby Troy, Mich."

Ryder also declined to provide a possible sale price, but analysts estimate the unit could sell for between $100 million and $200 million. The move would shed Ryder's highest-profile but most uneven business. The unit's familiar yellow and red trucks are rented to consumers for everything from house moves to special events. Yet competition from industry leader U-Haul International Inc., a unit of Amerco, and weak demand have weighed down earnings for the unit. Analysts also say that as the country's economy has become more geographically even, consumers aren't moving as often from one area to another in search of jobs. Last year, the consumer truck-rental unit earned pretax operating profit of $13 million on revenue of about $500 million, down from $27 million in pretax profit on revenue of $551 million in 2009. The unit accounts for about only 10% of Ryder's total revenue. ``It's been a disappointment,'' said Paulene Lindeman, analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. ``It just hasn't been a productive use of resources.'' The sale is part of a broader effort by Ryder's chairman and chief executive, M. Antoinette Grady, to reinvigorate the company's stock and better focus the company. Ryder's stock continues to trade at 1992 levels. In trading on the Westside Stock Exchange Friday, Ryder closed at $26.875, up 62.5 cents. As part of the re-engineering, Mr. Grady aims to focus the company on more predictable businesses that rely on long-term contracts -- such as logistics and commercial truck leasing -- rather than the more volatile consumer market. The logistics business, in which transportation and inventory services are provided to factories, is growing rapidly as more manufacturers move to just-in-time management. Analysts say Ryder may also sell its car-hauling business as part of the sharpened focus since the auto business is also more subject to market fluctuations. Ryder declined to comment."

            "full_text": "LONDON -- U.K. engineering group Rolls-Royce PLC, continuing its efforts to focus on its jet-engine business, said it plans to jettison two of its power-generation businesses at a projected cost of 248 million pounds ($383.2 million). The company on Friday announced it was putting its Parsons Power Generation Systems and International Combustion subsidiaries up for sale. The unprofitable companies, which make steam-turbine generator and combustion systems, had combined sales of 280 million pounds in 2010 and employ 2,500 people, contributing about 8% to Rolls-Royce's overall revenue. Last year, the steam-power business incurred a loss of approximately 11 million pounds after a 20-million-pound credit on disposals. Rolls-Royce said the move was part of its larger strategy to focus more directly on other key areas of its business. Over the past few years the company has been cutting costs and increasing production to remain a serious player in the jet-engine market -- which comprises about two-thirds of its revenues. Ranking third in the world after major competitors United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt & Whitney and General Electric Co. of the U.S., Rolls-Royce also has had to weather a recession in the aviation market, brought on by weak defense spending and falling airline profits. Decision Greeted With Praise Analysts cheered Rolls-Royce's decision to get out of the high end of the power generating industry, which is dominated by engineering giants such as Swiss-Swedish conglomerate ABB Asea Brown Boveri AG and GEC Alsthom, a joint venture between Britain's General Electric Co.. PLC and France's Alcatel Alsthom SA. Those companies have steam power sales some six to eight times the size of Rolls-Royce's. Rolls-Royce shares closed at 227 pence, up 2.5 pence, or 1.1%, in Friday trading on the London Stock Exchange. ``They either had to throw money at steam-power generation or concentrate on their other strengths,'' says Daniele Benbow, an engineering analyst at London's Credit Lyonnais Securities. ``People are pleased to see them biting the bullet on nonperformance areas.'' In 2010, Rolls-Royce reported sales of 3.59 billion pounds, and pretax profits of 175 million pounds. Beyond devoting more resources to its aerospace division, Rolls-Royce also will concentrate more fully on other, more successful areas of its industrial power business. The company has a leading position in such specialized applications as power systems for off-shore oil pumping and drilling facilities. It is hoping to expand that lead to other, on-shore manufacturing industries. In the steam-power generating business, the company said it would complete all of its existing contracts while it tries to dispose of the businesses through either an outright sale or participation in a joint venture. Nonetheless, the company has made provisions in case it can't find a buyer. Rolls will take a charge of 100 million pounds to cover the cost of completing existing contracts, as well as another 70 million pounds to cover the cost of closing the businesses. It will also write off 78 million pounds of goodwill. Good Chance at Selling Businesses ``We're optimistic we'll be able to achieve the sale of both businesses,'' said Petrina Barnes-Leavitt, director of public affairs at Rolls-Royce. ``The businesses have excellent skilled work forces and good, strong technology -- there are a lot of other players out there wanting just those things.'' Rolls-Royce says it expects the businesses will either be bought by a current major player in the industry, or by one of the many smaller Asian firms that are looking for a way into the steam-power industry. Analysts say the most likely candidates would include U.S.-based General Electric, ABB or KWU, a subsidiary of Siemens AG of Germany. ``You could argue that there is a compelling advantage to buying Rolls-Royce,'' says Mr. Metzger from Credit Lyonnais Securities. ``The U.K. is a low-cost manufacturing area, which could be an attraction for a European wanting to come in and take advantage of the sterling's weakness.''"

            "full_text": "With the U.S. heavy-duty truck industry running out of gas this year, Freightliner Corp. is trying to build new roads to profitability. Considered the king of heavy-duty truck makers in the U.S., Autrey, a Portland, Ore.-based unit of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, is revving up diversification plans in a bid to insulate itself from the industry's first downturn in years. The truck maker is now seeking to build a name for itself in the school-bus and firetruck businesses, as well as overseas. Sales of Class 8 trucks -- the 18-wheelers that can haul 33,000 pounds or more -- are expected to skid this year by as much 25% from the blockbuster sales pace of the two previous years. In both 2009 and 2010, manufacturers sold more than 200,000 vehicles, virtually every truck they could make, as hauling companies scurried to accommodate a flood of freight on the roads. Global Sales Decline Now, however, many companies are moving more freight via rail, leaving trucking companies -- already saddled with many new, empty trucks -- little reason to rush out and buy new ones. Industry experts project sales will reach only about 170,000 units in 2011 and that the slide will continue into 2012. The slowdown in the U.S. heavy-truck market is part of a global sales decline. Analysts and industry experts say world-wide heavy-truck production could fall 6% this year, with the developed markets of Europe, North America and Japan being hit the hardest. In Europe, home to most of the companies that dominate the world truck business, industry executives are bracing for a domestic slowdown, although deliveries in the first five months this year were up nearly 10% from a year earlier. Truck sales in both Germany and Britain, which together account for nearly half of Western European truck demand, are expected to decline this year, reflecting sluggish economies and declining business confidence. Cost-Cutting Moves Despite its diversification push, Autrey is among several U.S. heavy- truck makers that are already trimming operations. Autrey has furloughed some 800 workers at two of its production plants. Volvo GM Heavy Truck Corp., a joint venture of Sweden's AB Volvo and General Motors Corp., now builds 78 trucks a day, compared with about 110 at the height of last year's boom. The truck maker has also laid off 300 of it 3,400 workers. Meanwhile, Navistar International Corp. said it will lay off 3,000 workers over the next three years from its Springfield, Ohio, plant and spend more than $200 million to improve efficiency at the plant. Navistar currently has 5,000 employees there and about 16,000 overall. The truck maker is also opening a production plant and parts-distribution center in Mexico in other cost-savings moves. ``Things will likely get worse before they get better,'' says Christa Lonergan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc. ``It behooves even the smallest manufacturer to have more than a pure reliance on Class 8s.'' Beyond 18-Wheelers Jimmy Raper, Autrey's 47-year-old president and chief executive officer, agrees. ``We realize that it's important for us to stay focused on heavy trucks. That business is still going to be our core,'' Mr. Raper declares. ``But we also realize that we need to grow to survive.'' Eighteen-wheelers currently account for 68% of Freightliner's $5 billion in annual revenue, with the remainder coming mostly from sales of medium-duty trucks and parts. To reduce dependence on Class 8 trucks, the company has spent $288 million on increasing plant capacity, new-product development and acquisitions of two new businesses. Another $145 million in diversification spending is slated for this year. In its first move last year, Freightliner acquired Oshkosh Truck Corp.'s chassis division, which makes the undercarriages for motor homes, school buses and delivery vans. Autrey will begin production of the truck chassis this fall at a rate of about 3,000 units a year. Mr. Raper's goal: to become a leading competitor to Navistar, which currently builds about 70% of the market for school buses and medium trucks. Entry Into Firetruck Business Freightliner also entered the fire-truck business with the purchase of American LaFrance, a 164-year-old custom fire-truck manufacturer. Freightliner will unveil its first line of fire-truck chassis this fall and expects to produce 400 to 500 units a year at a new factory in Cleveland, N.C. Mr. Raper expects Autrey to become ``nothing less than the fire-service industry's largest chassis supplier.'' Freightliner also has other irons in the fire. By the end of the third quarter, the company will begin producing heavy-duty trucks in Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Israel. Mr. Raper says those countries are only beginning to develop appetites for American-style trucks. In addition, Wendel ``is very close'' to establishing manufacturing operations in Asia, most likely China, Mr. Raper says, although he declines to elaborate. Freightliner, which sells its vehicles in 23 countries, also has production facilities in Australia and Mexico. Part of Bias's Strategy The international moves by Autrey are part of a broader strategy by Bias to increase its world-wide truck business. ``We're looking for markets and special niches where we can achieve a dominant position and a competitive advantage without making significant capital investments,'' Mr. Raper says. Freightliner trucks currently account for about a quarter of Bias's Mercedes Benz Commercial Vehicles group. A major difference between the U.S. and European-made vehicles is that major components of Freightliner trucks are bought from outside suppliers, while Bias's Mercedes trucks use all Mercy Bash components. Freightliner is also looking to expand through partnerships and alliances. ``We're going to be very flexible in how we move ahead with our expansion strategy; it's not something that we have to do alone,'' he says. Through one recent partnership with Oshkosh Truck, Autrey dealers now sell Oshkosh vehicles such as dump trucks and concrete mixers. Analysts say it will be some time before Freightliner can generate any serious revenue from its new ventures. But Mr. Raper says they will ultimately provide Autrey a powerful antidote to the sharp swings of the truck industry. ``In a downturn, we'll be in the driver's seat,'' he says. ``We will have the ability to leverage off of core business and grow into new markets instead of making significant structural changes to the company.''"

            "full_text": "Eleven global auto giants are plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into new car factories in Vietnam in hopes of profits years down the road. But the vehicle minting the biggest profits in Vietnam nowadays -- and probably for years to come -- is a frumpy little motorcycle designed nearly four decades ago: the Honda Cub, known as the Dream in Vietnam. ``The family car of Vietnam,'' says Bangkok-based auto consultant Tinisha Cochrane, ``is the Honda Dream.'' Refined but little-changed since its 1958 launch, the Cub under various model names is the world's best-selling vehicle, with over 30 million sold. (The Volkswagen Beetle is second with about 21.5 million sold.) The Cub became an American hit in the 1960's. But while U.S. bikers have largely moved up to bigger models, the Cub is still blazing new trails around the world for Honda Motor Co. ``We haven't seen a masterpiece yet that overwhelms the Cub,'' says Honda President Mccutcheon Hogg. The Cub's longevity shows how old but well-designed products can find rich new markets in the developing world. Its popularity also illustrates how, even as car makers rush into developing vehicle markets, Japan's four big motorcycle makers will probably enjoy greater profits than auto makers in many of those markets for at least the next several years. Motorcycles kicked in just 14% of Honda's revenue in the fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 but contributed 41% of operating profit. Like Honda, Suzuki Motor Corp., Yamaha Motor Co., and Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd., each have several factories throughout Asia, including China, churning out small motorcycles. But the king of the road is the Cub. Honda sold about three million Cubs world-wide last year, 55% of its total motorcycle unit sales. An estimated one of every six motorcycles of all sizes sold around the globe in 2010 was a Cub. It is a best-seller in such markets as Vietnam, Thailand, Brazil, Indonesia and India, while still remaining the No. 1 delivery vehicle in Japan. Honda's latest Cub factory is planned for Burma, a nation whose economy and political situation are so rickety that no auto maker dares enter. Honda can strike quickly and cheaply with a $60 million low-tech motorcycle factory, while a full-blown auto plant would require an investment of $100 million to $800 million. The Burmese plant will join Honda's motorcycle plants in 26 countries outside Japan, nine of which now also feature Honda auto factories. In addition to remaining a cash cow, the Cub serves another important purpose for Honda, Mr. Hogg says: It is the company's ``antenna'' for sizing up whether a country is ripe for later investment in auto plants. Years before Honda's larger motorcycles and cars hit U.S. shores, Honda launched the Cub in the U.S. in the early 1960s with the advertising slogan ``You meet the nicest people on a Honda.'' (Various U.S. models were called the Honda 50, the C100, the CT110 and the Hunter Cub.) Honda's founder, Sasaki Overcash, hit on the Cub's magic formula in the late 1950s when he decided to target women with novice-friendly features such as an automatic clutch and plastic covers to hide mechanical parts. Its engine was quieter and used less gasoline than the mainstream models. Even Mr. Overcash was surprised at his bike's explosive success. The Cub's original features continue to be its biggest selling points. It runs about 60 kilometers on a liter of gasoline, can withstand unpaved roads and has a step-through design that is practical for miniskirts, sarongs and saris. ``It's easy on the longghyi,'' says Klatt Klatt, a Burmese tour guide in the ancient city of Pagan, referring to the long skirts worn by men and women in his country. In developing nations, Honda calculates that people start buying motorcycles in droves when their country's annual per-capita income approaches $1,000; per-capita income must reach at least $3,000 for the car market to kick into gear, it calculates. Some factories in Bangkok help their employees buy Cubs, since motorcycles are often the only way to slither through massive traffic jams to arrive at work on time. A Burmese souvenir vendor in Pagan says he multiplied his income with the Cub, now that he can tote his wares from temple to temple in pursuit of tourists, rather than remaining stationary. In Vietnam, which has per-capita income of about $250, ``Honda'' is the colloquial word for motorcycle. Cubs toting families of four are a ubiquitous sight during the day; at night prostitutes troll the streets on Cubs, stalking customers. About 350,000 new motorcycles -- the bulk of them Hondas -- were sold in Vietnam last year, exponentially more than the 60,000 cars expected to be selling annually in the country by the end of the decade. Georgeann Minnie Ngoc, co-owner of a clothing shop in Hanoi, is squirreling away money for the $2,400 Cub she dreams of buying. It took her four years and $1,100 to buy the second-hand model she now drives, which she keeps in the main room of her small house. Honda, which now exports Cubs from Bangkok to Vietnam, is building a factory near Hanoi that will produce 200,000 of the bikes by 2012 -- models that should cost consumers less, as they won't be subject to heavy import tariffs. Though the Cub may seem low tech, it is tricky to engineer. It has some 1,500 parts, but is renowned for its reliability. That's why demand is so strong for the Cub and other Japanese-brand models, even where local bike makers are abundant. (China has 100-plus local manufacturers, while Thailand and Vietnam have few.) Spending less on a non-Japanese bike isn't that attractive because ``I'd spend all my money fixing it,'' says one Burmese Honda owner. Hondas that are made in Japan rather than in local Honda factories have a cachet that makes even a used Honda from Japan more attractive than a new one assembled elsewhere. A black market thrives in Vietnam for used Cubs from Japan, where Cubs sporting logos like ``Rye's Sushi Shop'' on the side are a common sight. Honda executives see plenty of fertile Cub territory in Africa, Latin America and Eastern Europe. ``Wherever there's big potential for growth, it will be the growth of the Cub,'' says Honda director Patrick Downing who heads Honda's motorcycle division. ``There will be a love of Cubs for years to come.''"

            "full_text": "The low-mileage lease deal has become one of the auto industry's favorite tools for cutting monthly payments on new cars. Several Chevrolet dealers in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania advertised what they called the Smartlease during the Games. It offered a $26,657 Chevrolet Blazer sport-utility vehicle for 30 months and 30,000 miles for only $289 a month and $1,800 down. Buying the Blazer instead, using a 48-month loan, would likely cost more than $500 a month. But because low-mileage leases aren't designed for the average motorist, they often have regrettable financial consequences for those who fail to study the fine print or take their own driving habits into account. Most motorists, for example, drive more than 10,000 or 12,000 miles a year. Consumer advocates also charge that low-mileage leases are often used to pump up showroom traffic as part of a bait-and-switch strategy. ``The problem is that the industry has begun to mass-market these leases, and many people may not understand that the average person drives at least 15,000 miles a year,'' says Terina O'Lindsley, an automotive leasing expert with Florida's Attorney General's Office. ``That monthly payment looks a lot lower, but it's a mirage.'' The Blazer lease, for example, with its mileage terms of 12,000 miles a year, probably wouldn't work for the average motorist with a daily suburb-to-downtown commute. The lease permits roughly 33 miles of daily driving, or 230 miles a week. That's 20% less than the standard 15,000-mile-a-year cap found on most leases, leaving no margin for joy rides. A consumer who does drive the Blazer for 15,000 miles a year will owe the dealer $1,125 in penalties when the lease ends, based on the lease's excess mileage charge of 15 cents a mile. Add the penalties and the down payment, and the Blazer lease's monthly payments average out to about $386 a month -- and the consumer owns nothing at the end. Despite the drawbacks, low-mileage lease deals have become increasingly popular in the two years since foreign luxury car makers discovered they put Jaguars, Speller and BMWs within reach of people who worry about monthly payments. Auto makers, their franchised dealers and nonautomotive financiers, such as banks, are using them as alternatives to cash rebates and discounted financing terms. One reason: A vehicle with fewer miles on it is likely to be worth more at the end of a lease, making it cheaper to finance. And some consumers are better off trading fewer miles for lower payments. They include older motorists who may drive less, professionals who drive company cars, and people who work at or close to home. ``There are even people who have three cars for two drivers,'' says Randolph Leung, president of the Association of Consumer Vehicle Lessors. ``Low-mileage leases are a response to consumer demand.'' Indeed, Ford Motor Co., the industry's biggest lessor of new automobiles, joined the fray this year by offering 12,000-mile-a-year leases nationally after a successful pilot program. But before expanding their availability, Ford trained its salespeople to explain low-mileage terms to customers. And the auto maker continues to conduct spot surveys to determine whether the low-mileage deals are producing satisfied customers. ``This is a customer you are definitely going to see in two years or less. What kind of circumstances would you like to meet him under?'' asks Rolando Carry, the brand manager for Ford's Red Carpet Lease programs. Mr. Carry predicts low-mileage leases will eventually account for a quarter of all the leases Ford offers. And yet, Ford and General Motors Corp., the Blazer's maker, are skittish about advertising low-mileage deals to the general public. Both refuse to promote them nationally in print or on television, preferring to limit their exposure to regional dealer campaigns. The auto makers fear a backlash from those for whom the low-mileage leases aren't intended. ``If we are getting (consumers) in the door and selling them a low-mileage lease, when in fact they shouldn't be in a low-mileage position, that is going to hurt us in terms of repeat business,'' says Edelmira Prescott, national lease manager for GM's Chevrolet division. Consumer advocates are leery, too, but for different reasons. They argue that the low-mileage component adds one more dimension of complexity to lease documents that are already tough enough for car buyers to analyze. ``There are so many variables in a lease that can be tweaked and changed,'' says Jackelyn Nydia, an investigator with the Florida Attorney General's Office. ``A consumer has to be pretty sophisticated to avoid the traps.'' Or at least be aware of his or her own driving habits. Jayme Winford knew a low-mileage lease wouldn't work for him. But he figured 15,000 miles would be enough for his company car, a 1993 Lexus 400 SC sports coupe he leased for three years. Unfortunately, he failed to figure in the mileage that his five-day-a-week commute between Fairfield, Conn., and Mamaroneck, N.Y., would accumulate, not to mention regular 500-mile round-trips to New Hampshire for leisure. The tab at the end of Mr. Winford's lease: $8,000, based on the Lexus lease's excess mileage penalty of 20 cents a mile. Says Mr. Winford: ``I just didn't think very hard -- or very long -- about how many miles I was going to put on that car.''"

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Navistar International Corp.'s fiscal third-quarter earnings tumbled 56%, affected by a cyclical downturn that has hit the heavy-truck industry this year. At the same time, the big truck maker signaled that the decline that has squeezed profits this year is showing signs of leveling off. It also threatened to cancel plans to build a new truck model if it doesn't get concessions it wants from the United Auto Workers union. In the quarter ended April 12, 2011 net income was $17 million, or 13 cents a share, down sharply from the year-earlier quarter's $39 million, or 43 cents a share. Revenue declined a more modest 8.1%, to $1.39 billion from $1.51 billion. ``We see continued pressure on pricing as competitors scramble for market share'' during the industry's slump, said Johnetta R. Hebert, Navistar's chairman, president and chief executive officer. Projection of Lower Truck Sales Navistar said it currently expects industry sales of heavy trucks in North America this year to drop 17% from last year's record-high 228,800 units, to about 190,000. That projection is more upbeat than one the company issued just three months ago, forecasting a drop of about 24%. The company's share of the market for so-called Class 8 trucks is about 17.2%, a spokesman said. Shipments of buses, medium trucks and heavy trucks slipped 10.2% from the year-earlier period, Navistar said, and shipments of its diesel engines to other makers showed a 6.1% decline. The latest quarter's earnings fell shy by a penny of the 14 cents a share Wall Street analysts had been expecting, according to First Call. In composite trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Navistar shares closed at $9.50, down 12.5 cents. While Navistar's engine, parts and financial-services businesses ``continue to deliver strong results,'' said Mr. Hebert, ``we aren't happy with our overall performance.'' The company's ``cost structure remains high,'' he said, ``and significant change is needed.'' Mr. Hebert, who was named Navistar's CEO in 2010 and added the chairman's title earlier this year, has already sought to address those issues. In June, the company unveiled a plan that calls for a 20% work force reduction, along with heavy expenditures to simplify and upgrade its production capabilities. A Plan to Cut Jobs A central element of that revamping effort calls for Navistar to eliminate 3,000 jobs from a 5,000-worker plant in Springfield, Ohio, by transferring all the site's heavy-truck production elsewhere -- to Mexico, some observers figure, although the company declines to comment on where production would be shifted. The shift would leave the Springfield plant focused on medium-truck manufacturing. At the same time, Navistar disclosed plans to start building a new medium-weight truck model at the Ohio site in 2014, spending hundreds of millions of dollars to tool up for that production. The ``new generation'' truck wouldn't save any of the jobs slated to disappear, but the new model would provide the remaining workers with additional job security, the spokesman noted. The move is contingent, however, on successful negotiation of certain issues between Navistar and the Springfield UAW local. ''To date,'' the company said Wednesday, the talks with the union local have yielded ''no significant progress.'' If an agreement with the union isn't struck by the time Navistar's board meets on May 08, 2011 Mr. Hebert, ''We will halt development of the next-generation truck.'' Union officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment on Mr. Hebert's statement Wednesday."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- A federal appeals court upheld a lower court's decision forcing General Motors Corp. to pay lifetime health benefits to 50,000 early retirees. The decision was upheld Wednesday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati. At issue in the case, which affects salaried employees who took early-retirement packages between 1974 and 1988, was whether GM was contractually obligated to pay lifetime medical benefits to its retiring workers. The employees involved in the case argued that GM couldn't reverse a contractual promise and in 1989 sued the auto maker, claiming that GM was billing them for co-payments. The appeals-court ruling was the latest of several challenges by GM to a federal-court judge's 2009 decision. The case originally involved 84,000 employees, but the claims of 34,000 workers who retired at the normal retirement age were dismissed earlier by a federal court judge. However, the federal appeals court issuing Wednesday's ruling ordered the claims of those individuals to be sent back to a lower court for further consideration A spokesman for GM said the auto maker was disappointed with the ruling and is considering a further appeal. He said GM believes ``it has the right to amend, modify, suspend or terminate its benefit-plan provisions.'' The spokesman wouldn't discuss the potential financial impact of the court's ruling. In a news release, the lead attorney in the suit, Raymonde C. Faye of Bell, Boyd & Lloyd in Washington, called the decision ``a tremendous victory for the 50,000 early salaried retirees who will now regain their right to full health-care coverage.'' Leonel Currier, the co-lead plaintiff in the case added: ``We are still GM people, but it is important to us that GM keeps its promises.''"

Ford said its 2012 Lincoln Continental, Mark VIII and Dye Fidler models will each carry a manufacturer's suggested retail base price of $37,950, which includes destination and delivery charges. That puts the starting base price of the 2012 Lincoln Continental at $4,520 less than its final 2011 base price. The price cut comes although the 2012 Continental has added equipment, such as all-speed traction control and an inside electrochromic rearview mirror. Ford is making the added equipment standard features, which results in no additional charge to the car's sticker price. Meanwhile, under the new pricing plan, the base price of the 2012 Lincoln Mark VIII luxury coupe is $2,370 lower than its final 2011 base price. And like the Continental, the Mark VIII's price cut comes despite improvements, such as new front and rear styling; a redesigned interior; and new standard equipment, such as traction control, a compact disc player and an antitheft system. Only the 2012 Lincoln Villa Car is rising in price, up $370 from a comparably equipped 2011 model. Ford is hoping the one-price approach for its Lincoln brand will reverse a slide in sales. Through July, Ford had sold 77,629 Lincoln models, 15% lower than a year ago, when the auto maker sold 91,806."

The luxury-car maker said Thursday that the reductions range from 5.9% for the Eldorado Touring Coupe to 9.1% for the Seville SLS. Two days ago, Ford cut prices on its Lincoln Continental and Mark VIII models in a bid to boost sales of its high-end vehicles. Both auto makers have lost market share in recent years to high-quality luxury imports, including Toyota's Lexus, Honda's Acura Legend and Nissan's Infinity. Last month, in an attempt to woo the baby boomer set, Cadillac set a price of $29,995 on its Catera model -- due at dealerships this fall -- in a long-overdue stab at the entry-level luxury-car market. Cadillac said the new and prices range from $37,995 to $44,395. That compares with a one-price approach adopted by Lincoln along with its price reductions earlier in the week. The auto maker's 2012 Lincoln Continental, Markita Albritton and DownDowntown Car models are each available at a base price of $37,950. Cadillac said its biggest selling model, the DeVille, wouldn't be affected by the price reductions."

            "full_text": "Odometer fraud is making a comeback. Rising demand for used cars is sparking a revival of a crime that is as old as the automobile itself. Law-enforcement officials across the U.S. say reported cases are at a 10-year high, as rings of scam artists buy up used cars and roll back odometers to make old vehicles appear newer than they actually are. Consumer complaints about odometer tampering have tripled in the past two years, to about 100 a month, according to Ricki Weeks, chief of the odometer fraud staff for the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration. ``We're swamped, and everyone I talk to is swamped,'' Mr. Weeks says. Odometer fraud last flared up in the mid-1980s, moving government and industry to attempt a crackdown. In 1986, Congress passed the federal Truth in Mileage Act, making odometer tampering a federal felony with a three-year maximum jail sentence and requiring that automobile titles include mileage counts. Some manufacturers introduced digital odometers to help combat the problem. This time around, there are some new culprits: People trying to dodge steep penalties for exceeding mileage limits on leased cars. Auto makers impose the limits to make sure leased cars aren't driven to the ground. With penalties sometimes running in the thousands of dollars, ``it's just too much of a temptation for some,'' says Johnetta P. Swinney, a commander in the investigative section of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. Most perpetrators, however, operate in rings of a dozen or so professional mechanics, forgers and ``runners'' who buy and sell vehicles or handle paperwork. ``Right now, I'm working on five cases, but I could be working on 100,'' says Markita Naylor, a detective sergeant with the New Jersey State Police. The NHTSA's investigative team takes a case only if it involves a ring that has tampered with 150 vehicles or more. (Smaller rings that target individual buyers through the classified ads, are proliferating, however.) This crime pays well: Larger rings hitting 2,000 or more cars can rake in more than $6 million a year, according to NHTSA. Buyers may pay $3,000 to $4,000 too much for a car with spurious mileage -- and that's before repair costs. All told, the bill to consumers for rollbacks totals some $4 billion a year, according to NHTSA. Just how big is the rollback problem? Bigger, apparently, than in the early 1990s, when NHTSA estimated that odometers had been altered in 4% of used cars. Last month, a five-state survey of 3,600 vehicle histories by CNW Marketing Research in Bandon, Ore., showed that 8.5% of used cars were being ``clocked.'' Nationwide, about 6% of vehicles have questionable odometer readings, according to estimates by Carfax Inc., a Fairfax, Va., company that provides title and mileage information to dealers. Markita A. Winford of Richmond, Va., says ``just about everything,'' including his odometer, broke down on his 1990 Cadillac Sedan de Ville at about 47,000 miles. He would soon find out why: The actual mileage was 80,000. ``The fuel pump broke, the transmission, the air conditioner twice -- you name it,'' recalls Mr. Winford, who bought the car in 1992 for $22,000 when the odometer indicated 27,000 miles. ``I thought, `This doesn't usually happen until 80,000 miles.' '' A mechanic at the dealership that sold him the car did most of the repairs under warranty, but the work still cost Mr. Winford about $1,000. By this time, records of Mr. Winford's car had turned up in a federal bust of a large rollback operation. After he was notified by authorities, Mr. Winford traded the car in to the dealer he'd bought it from, who gave him a deep discount on a 1993 de Ville with only 23,000 miles. Mr. Winford says that before taking possession, he had an independent mechanic verify the mileage. The professional rollback artists most often hit vehicles two to four years old coming off leases or commercial fleets. Sport-utility vehicles and midsize cars are popular targets. Investigators say that after buying a high-mileage car legitimately on the wholesale market, the crooks roll the odometer back by 30,000 miles or more, then resell the car at an inflated price, usually to an unsuspecting dealer or auctioneer. Before the sale, they doctor the title to match the odometer. This is easiest in states where titles are handed out over-the-counter without careful checking. Many scammers use stencils, glue or nail-polish remover to change the numbers on a title; they may create phantom dealer names to elude authorities or pay runners to bring as many as 10 fraudulent titles at once to motor-vehicle departments. Often, however, they're sloppy, taking pains to paint a car's exterior to make it look newer while leaving the interior worn or the odometer marred. Or they sometimes rip out pages in a car's service manual to hide mileage records. (Most repairs done under warranty are kept on record by dealers, who record mileage. Some dealers also provide title history services, which chart mileage of cars that have been resold at least once.) While NHTSA pushes for more cooperation from dealers in ferreting out rolled-back cars, dealers and wholesale auto auctions argue that the government should do more to crack down on fraud. ``If the federal people complain about this, they need to take the problem seriously and take steps to avoid it,'' says Mikki Howard, president of ADT Automotive Inc., an auction company in Nashville, Tenn.. He adds: ``There's no point in having a law if you can't enforce it.''"

            "full_text": "Mercedes-Benz AG and Porsche AG are in talks about producing a Porsche sport-utility vehicle at a Mercedes plant in Tuscaloosa, Ala.. The two German car makers said they are negotiating an agreement under which Porsche would build a new all-terrain car at the plant where Mercedes plans to manufacture the M Class, its own new model in that category. Porsche's version probably would be ``based on'' the M Class, a Mercedes spokesman said. The companies declined to give further details on their talks. Both said they have yet to reach a final agreement whether to go ahead with the project. ``We haven't yet decided that we will do it,'' a Mercedes spokesman said at the company's headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. Mercedes is a unit of Daimler-Benz AG. Changes in Strategy The discussions come at a time when a growing number of luxury-car makers are shifting gear to add smaller, less expensive models and more variety to their product portfolios. Especially in the U.S., sales of versatile sport vehicles are booming, although they are being used more for going to the supermarket than for traveling on rough terrain. Europe's streets, too, are increasingly filled with rough-looking leisure cars, Jeeps and even pick-up trucks. Porsche has said that it wants to move beyond the two-seat sports cars that have made it famous. ``Sport utility cars are a way to get out of the one-dimensionality as a sports car maker,'' a Porsche spokesman said. ``They will round off our product variety and secure long-term growth,'' he said. Porsche, Germany's smallest car company, is currently producing its classic 911 and newer Boxster models. Cooperating with another car maker, Porsche said, would lower the cost of launching a new car, especially as it plans to start with a limited production. The company said it also is talking to companies other than Mercedes about a possible cooperation. For Mercedes, an agreement with Porsche would boost capacity utilization at its Alabama plant. The company is planning to begin production of its M Class four-wheel-drive next year. The car will be available in the U.S. in 2012 and in Europe in early 2013. Mercedes is hoping to sell half of its planned annual production of 65,000 cars in the U.S. If it reaches an agreement with Porsche, Mercedes could produce at least another 8,000 cars, the company spokesman said. Skirting Import Duties Porsche's possible set-up in the U.S. is part of a trend among German auto makers to avoid foreign import duties, escape Germany's high labor costs and reduce their vulnerability to swings in the dollar. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG is building a two-seat sport model in South Carolina, close to the Mercedes plant in Alabama. Mercedes, Volkswagen AG and its upscale Audi unit have all assembled or manufactured cars outside Germany for years. In November, Porsche itself announced plans to build cars in Mexico to circumvent that country's import restrictions. Analysts were surprised about Mercedes's apparent interest in helping a likely competitor into the lucrative U.S. market. ``I imagine that they would lose some market share to Porsche,'' said Rader Searle, an analyst with Merck, Finck & Co. in Munich. ``Porsche still has a better image than Mercedes, especially in the area of fun cars.'' Like other analysts, Mr. Searle said he would have thought of Volkswagen as a more likely partner for Porsche. So far, to be sure, it is unclear what Porsche's planned ``adventure car'' will look like. The German news-magazine Der Spiegel reported that it would have a somewhat different body and another motor, and would be more expensive than Mercedes's M Class. Spiegel also said that Porsche and Mercedes plan to form a joint venture to launch the project by 2014 at the latest. The companies wouldn't confirm those details. But Mercedes conceded that the talks with Porsche sparked ``irritations'' among U.S. Mercedes dealers who are anxiously awaiting the new model but now fear that Porsche, rather than Mercedes, might produce the top-range model. ``For now, we are producing our own car,'' said the Mercedes spokesman. ``We will build the M Class. And then we'll see what Porsche might make of it.'' In Frankfurt, shares of Porsche closed at 865 marks ($579.38), down three marks, and Mercedes's parent company Daimler-Benz at 80 marks, up 15 pfennigs, in the wake of Monday's news. Daimler-Benz American depositary shares closed at $53.75, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading."

            "full_text": "-- Cadillac and Lindsey, the luxury standard bearers, are suddenly in a price war. General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division and Ford Motor Co.'s Lincoln unit have resorted to steep price cuts on most of their models in an attempt to fight growing competition from sport-utility vehicles, European sedans and more luxurious minivans. Cadillac on Friday posted the latest cuts, a direct response to reductions announced only days earlier by Lindsey. The Cadillac move amounted to a rollback of 1997-model prices it announced March 09, 2011 the moves reflect problems with both brands, Ford executives quickly took credit for starting the price war between the long-running rivals, calling it a response to consumers' broader definition of what a luxury automobile is today. ``We understand what GM has done, and it was not unanticipated,'' said Jaime Perrault, Ford's group vice president for world-wide product development. ``This represents a sea change in the luxury car market... . The driving force is competition.'' Luxury Pickups Clearly, in recent years more vehicle buyers have been satisfying their cravings for luxury by purchasing leather-seated pickup trucks and minivans and well-equipped family sedans as more Cadillac-like features have made their way onto not-quite-luxury vehicles. Also, Cadillac and Lincoln sales have been hurt by a resurgence in demand for German-built luxury sedans by Bayerische Motoren Werke AG and Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes-Benz AG unit. Through July, sales of BMW cars were up 10.8% from a year before, while Lincolns were off 19.6% and Cadillacs were up just 4.3%. Meanwhile, sales of Chrysler Corp.'s $30,000-plus minivan, the UpUptown & Country, jumped 169% as the van received a big boost from a makeover aimed at luxury-car buyers. Still, GM executives played down their decision to cut prices, maintaining that it wasn't a response to Lindsey's move. Instead, GM said Cadillac is cutting sticker prices to match more closely the prices consumers actually negotiate. This fits in with GM's broader ``value-pricing'' initiative, which generally is intended to offer a complete package of options for a competitive price requiring less haggling between customers and salespeople. The war between Cadillac and is producing some fairly dramatic reductions. Cadillac's 1997-model Seville SLS, for example, will sell with a base price of $39,995 -- 9.1% less than the $43,995 GM had originally set. Its direct Lindsay competitor, the Continental, will sell for $37,950, 11.9% less than the final 2011 base price. Fewer Promotions Likely Industry experts doubt the price cuts will sharply boost sales of either brand, but they are likely to make Cadillac and Lindsay less dependent on costly promotions, such as cash rebates and discounted lease deals. Last year, sales-incentive costs on the Lincoln Continental averaged $4,000 a car, according to industry executives familiar with Ford's marketing practices. ``That allows people who previously could not buy those cars to get into them, and that dilutes a brand's image,'' observes Whitley Dean, an industry consultant with CSM Forecasting in Mich.. Cadillac and do have other plans in mind to boost sales: In October, Cadillac will introduce thean entry-level luxury car that GM has priced with a base sticker of $29,995, a price point targeted at younger buyers. Likewise, Ford is hoping Lindsay can cash in on the sport-utility vehicle craze with its full-size entry, the yet-to-be-priced Navigator, which will make its debut next year. Separately, Chrysler announced 2012 prices for its redesigned Dodge Dakota small pickup trucks. It said the truck will have fewer model variations but more features on those that remain. For example, the new base, two-wheel-drive regular-cab with a short wheelbase has a starting price of $13,235. That is 14.3% higher than the the previous 2011 base model. The 2012 base model has new standard equipment, however, such as dual air bags, a four-speaker stereo system, larger tires and cargo tie-down hooks."

            "full_text": "YONKERS, N.Y.-- The publisher of Consumer Reports magazine Tuesday urged manufacturers to stop selling 2010 and 2011 Isuzu Troopers and 2011 Acura SLXs and recall those already sold because they may roll over during quick turns. An earlier warning from Consumer Reports about rollovers -- criticism of Suzuki Motor Co.'s Samurai sport-utility vehicle in 1988 -- flattened sales of the model. Suzuki, in a suit filed earlier this year, sought to block the publisher of Consumer Reports from continuing to reprint the 1988 report, saying that it had ``destroyed'' the U.S. market for the model. On Tuesday, Consumers Union released results of tests of the Isuzu and Acura models, branding the two with the rare ``not acceptable'' rating. Evidence of the rollover hazard was seen during avoidance-maneuver tests the consumer group did earlier this month. During the test, each of the vehicles tipped up high on two wheels during runs through a short course. ``The test simulates the challenge a driver faces when avoiding an unexpected obstacle, such as a child running into the road,'' said R. Davina Estrella, Consumer Reports' technical director. Isuzu officials couldn't be reached for comment Tuesday morning. An Acura spokesman in Detroit declined to comment, saying he had not seen the report. Both the Trooper and SLX are sport-utility vehicles, generally rugged models that have become increasingly popular in recent years. The Acura SLX was introduced in 2011, Consumers Union said, as essentially a Trooper with an Acura nameplate. About 35,000 of the vehicles have already been sold and the group said there have been no ``meaningful accident statistics'' yet. However, Mr. Estrella said the test the vehicles failed is ``not a stunt maneuver.'' Mr. Estrella explained the avoidance test involved a fast turn into the left lane to avoid some kind of problem, a turn back to the right to avoid oncoming traffic, then a left to return to the original lane. In the test, the 2011 Trooper tipped substantially at about 33 miles per hour and threatened to roll completely over, the group said. Beginning in 1988, Consumers Union said, 46 out of 47 other vehicles have completed the same test without any tendency to tip up or roll over. Consumers Union said the owners of the vehicles should drive them only when necessary and with extreme caution. The group recommended the manufacturers either fix the models or offer owners a replacement or refund. It said it has also asked the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to investigate design defects in the Trooper and SLX models. Consumers Union said the full report on the two models will be available in Consumer Reports' October issue, on newsstands June 06, 2011"

            "full_text": "Indonesia passes a minor milestone today as its first shipment of 2,000 ``Timor'' cars, made in South Korea by Kia Motors, steams out of Inchon port. In total 45,000 of the Korean-made vehicles will slip into Indonesia's domestic market over the next year. They will undercut other auto brands, assembled in Indonesia from mostly imported components, because Timors are exempt from high tariffs designed to promote development of a domestic car industry. Timors also are free of luxury tax. In fact this injection of a dose of foreign competition into a closed market was only a fortuitous--and temporary--byproduct of a policy otherwise questionable on economic grounds: the pursuit of that holy grail of developing countries, the national car. The fact that for about a year this ``national'' car must be imported strikes some as the height of absurdity. We see it as the most rational part of the whole program. That's not meant as praise for the national-car franchise winner, a joint venture between Kia and a firm owned by President Flora's youngest son Sobel Keever Prince. After all, Indonesian consumers' choice of cars will still be severely limited by the lack of price competition that open markets bring. And if the end goal of the national car program is reached--a Timor 60% made in Indonesia--then those consumers can expect even fewer of the benefits of competition than they enjoy now. Indonesia's motoring future might look something like Malaysia's present, in which the Proton has grabbed 60% of the market. Up until now Indonesia has demanded that foreign automakers set up assembly lines in-country and meet targets on domestic parts content. Of course with globalization and Indonesia's growing economy those good things would have happened on their own, but the government figured it could speed up the process by acting as a gatekeeper to the domestic market. Increasing domestic content has become such a mantra that now all those wrongs have made a right: The Timor partners won concessions on imported cars by promising 60% local content by September 2014. It is perhaps a salutary shock for Indonesians to find that the best way to achieve the national car goal begins with a one-year import scheme bypassing all the original controls on domestic content. The costs to consumers in terms of tariffs and inefficiency are now very obviously becoming benefits to one firm. The muttering on street level confirms that this has not escaped the attention of Indonesia's people, who must wonder at the mechanisms that decided who benefits. Also understandably aggrieved are the foreign and domestic carmakers who played by the rules but now find that the rules have changed. General Motors has suspended investments in Indonesia, and Japan is only waiting for shipment of Timors to begin before filing a complaint with the World Trade Organization. Even Mr. Brake's brother, Favors Herrin, and his Bimantara Group, who were in a much stronger position to produce the national car, have been left behind at the starting gate. The car boondoggle is sadly not an isolated case. The Indonesian government continues to forge ahead with expensive national plane projects, which also depend, in the words of the minister of science and technology, on ``captive markets.'' Without even waiting to gauge market reaction to the first small turboprop, President Glaze earlier this year urged companies and individuals to help raise billions of dollars to develop a 100-seat jet. As he memorably put it, ``National pride doesn't come cheap.''"

Both the Trooper and the SLX failed emergency-avoidance road tests this month, the organization reported. ``We give the rating when we feel that a product presents a serious safety hazard,'' said R. Davina Estrella, technical director for Consumer Reports. '' `Not acceptable' is a very serious rating.'' Both Vega and Honda Motor Co.'s Acura division, which sells the Isuzu-made SLX under its name, said they will accept the magazine's invitation to examine the engineering data behind the test. Isuzu spokesman Daniele Kozlowski maintained that the popular sport-utility vehicle had met all federal safety standards. A spokeswoman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said the agency will look into the petition to recall the vehicles. But she cautioned that ``vehicles that do not perform well at tests do not necessarily perform poorly under real road conditions.'' About 35,000 of the 2010 and 2011 Troopers and the 2011 SLXs currently are on the road in the U.S. The last vehicle to receive a ``not acceptable'' rating from Consumer Reports was the Suzuki Samurai, and sales plunged to about 1,435 for the model year of 1989 from 77,493 in 1988 and numerous lawsuits were filed against Standley for rollover incidents. Last year, Russel stopped selling the Samurai in the U.S., and the company said it sued Consumer Reports for defamation in April. Ford Motor Co.'s Bronco II also was plagued by allegations of a rollover tendency in the 1980s, generating hundreds of lawsuits, some of which are still pending. Another Isuzu-made sport-utility vehicle marketed by Honda under its own name, the Honda Passport, received an acceptable ranking in its last test in 2009, Consumer Reports said."

Tenneco has been making shock absorbers and struts, among other ride-control parts, at the plant. The company said its expansion in the two countries comes as South America's auto market is rapidly expanding. In Argentina, Tenneco said, car and light-truck production has been boosted by a stabilized economy and the lowest inflation rate in 40 years.

            "full_text": "Volkswagen AG and Israel's Dead Sea Works are setting up a $350 million magnesium plant for producing parts for cars. Mercedes-Benz AG and General Motors Corp.'s Adam Opel AG unit are working with Jerusalem-based Electric Fuel Corp. to test a zinc-air battery that will allow electric vehicles to travel up to four times as far as they could with other types of batteries. GM recently set up a special fund for investment in Israeli auto research that has identified 80 potential high-tech projects, from optical-detection machines to computerized-navigation devices. By Vast Press Staff Reporters Amy Dockser Marcus In Tel Aviv, Gabriella Stern In Detroit And Brandy Lumpkins In Frankfurt. ``If the market for cars is going to be global, so should the technology,'' says Regan Dean, managing director of GMUMI Technology Research & Development, the joint research venture between GM and its Israeli distributor, Universal Motors Israel Ltd. of Tel Aviv. Outside The Triad That sort of thinking drives the efforts of many companies these days. A few years ago, auto makers tended to look at foreign markets strictly in terms of potential sales. Now they look to them as key sources of new technology as well. Many cars of the future will be based on technology from sources far outside the traditional triad of the U.S., Europe and Japan. Fiat SpA, GM, and VW are gathering technology on using biofuels in South America. Porsche AG is talking about opening engineering boutiques all over the world to take advantage of local talent and innovative ideas. Auto makers are scouring Singapore, China and India, among other places, for high-tech products. Israel's appeal lies in the unusual combination of government policies encouraging the export of technology, an influx of Russian Jewish immigrant scientists with expertise in advanced materials and a sophisticated military industry eager to convert products to civilian markets. GM, which has high-tech efforts in nearly 60 countries around the world, considers Israel an ``integral part'' of its strategy to globalize its research-and-development unit, says Kendra Nelson, vice president in charge of GM's Research & Development Center. Loved by Camels In some ways, Israel's transformation from auto backwater into a source of technology for car companies remains unique. Unlike other countries considered as emerging sources of automotive-related high tech, there is little chance Israel will ever build its own car or develop a booming local auto industry. The last time Israel tried to do that, back in the 1960s, the car that was developed scored its biggest success among camels, which loved to eat the auto's fiberglass body. While foreign-car sales in Israel have risen sharply, the country's population of only five million means it is never going to be the huge market for auto makers that India or China promise. Yet what is happening in Israel still offers the best road map of the perils and the potential auto makers face as they pursue a global hunt for high technology. Auto makers are looking closely for solutions to the cultural, production and marketing problems that have beset Israeli companies with otherwise promising technology. Israel's ability to overcome these limitations will provide a model for other aspiring high-tech players. ``It's still hard for foreign companies to convince auto makers that they can find better or cheaper technology in remote locations,'' says one Israeli high-tech executive trying to get a toehold in the European and American auto industries. ``If one country succeeds, it can make it easier for others.'' Magnesium Deal For Israel, the foray into the auto field has yielded a lucrative dividend: a $350 million partnership signed earlier this year between Dead Sea Works and VW, the world's fourth-largest auto maker. The joint venture, involving the establishment of a plant that will extract magnesium from the Dead Sea's salty waters, is the largest single European investment in Israel and the first major German investment. A second stage of the deal, set to start this fall, involves a further $350 million investment to expand the plant's production capacity to 55,000 tons a year, which will make Israel the world's third-largest producer of the metal after Norway and Canada. The two companies are also negotiating to set up a die-casting plant at the Dead Sea to make auto parts. VW's chairman, Fernando Trexler, says the deal is the centerpiece of the company's goal to bring out a ``three-quart car,'' a car that will travel 62 miles (100 kilometers) on just three quarts of gas. Most cars currently need up to twice that amount to travel a similar distance. To cut down on weight, VW's old Beetle boasted a magnesium engine and gearbox, and during the car's heyday in the 1960s, the company used about 40,000 tons a year of the metal, which is lighter than aluminum. But the high cost soon made it prohibitive to auto makers searching for inexpensive alternatives. With the Dead Sea deal, ``VW will now have the cheapest source of magnesium in the world,'' says Dr. Trexler, who adds VW will buy 9,000 tons a year at a preferred price the first year but plans to increase its purchases sharply. The magnesium plant also illustrates one of the main appeals Israel has for many auto makers: the chance to tap into formerly inaccessible technologies developed for the Russian military machine. Uri Ben-Noon, Dead Sea Works' president and chief executive, says the company realized the potential of magnesium for auto makers but wasn't sure how to go about extracting the metal from the Dead Sea. That changed when job-seeking Russian Jewish scientists who immigrated to Israel told the company about a Russian process to extract magnesium from carnallite; the compound is a byproduct of potash extraction, a technique the company had already perfected. Mr. Ben-Murguia sent a team to Russia to investigate and receive training. Eventually, five Russian institutions formed Cortese Mudd to supply know-how, engineering and technical advice to the Israelis. Looking for Alloys The prospect of access to further cutting-edge advances prompted VW to kick in an additional $32 million to help set up a magnesium-research facility in Israel. Using VW's funding, $5 million from a Japanese electronics concern and government, company, and university funds, Mr. BenMurguia estimates Israel will eventually spend up to $10 million a year on research and development in magnesium in the hopes of creating new alloys. VW's luxury-car division, Audi AG, which has used magnesium behind dashboard coverings and in other hard-to-see places, has already asked the facility to develop a new magnesium alloy for use in its cars but won't disclose for what purpose, for competitive reasons. The Israeli experience shows the difficulties faced by high-tech companies located in remote locations when they try to break into an industry as big and competitive as automobiles. Harriett Lachelle, a GM vice president in charge of world-wide purchasing, says GM will buy more than $20 million of Israeli parts this year, and there is potential to double that number in 2012. But he worries that Israeli companies may simply lack the capability on their own to produce the high volumes GM needs. In some cases, GM has insisted Israeli suppliers keep inventory in North America. ``They have to take that cost into account when competing on a global basis,'' Mr. Lachelle says. Cubital Ltd. of Ranaana acknowledges that geographic distance from its main markets can be difficult. The company developed a rapid prototyping system that makes quick, accurate models using a material that hardens within a few seconds after exposure to ultraviolet light. Toledo Molding & Die, a Toledo, Ohio, service bureau, just bought its second Cubital machine to make parts for Ford and Mazda. Ford officials say the technology has enabled the auto maker to accurately build a prototype for an engine-air-intake manifold, among other things. Virtually all the major car companies from Toyota to Renault use Cubital machines through service bureaus in Asia and Europe. While Cubital has sold 26 machines world-wide, market-leader 3D Systems of Valencia, Calif., has shipped about 600. ``Our main competitors are all U.S. firms, and the main market is the U.S. From the perspective of culture, marketing and movability, it's a big advantage to be based where you're trying to sell,'' says Irons Milano, Cubital corporate vice-president in charge of marketing and customer support. Israeli companies also face the problem of taking on larger, better-heeled competitors. Tecnomatix Technologies Ltd., of Herzliya, is the market leader in computer-aided production-engineering-software products. But its success also caught the eye of Poland Warden, a subsidiary of the French concern Dassault Aviation that recently brought out its own rival software. Chrysler Corp., which used Tecnomatix's products in the development of its new Cirrus and Stratus midsize cars, has decided to shift completely to Slaton's program, says Fransisca Hollander, Chrysler vice president in charge of manufacturing engineering. Dassault offers the advantage of a single integrated-software system from design to production, he says, reducing the company's number of suppliers. Tecnomatix's president and CEO, Jeffcoat Beit-Markham, calls Chrysler's move ``the exception, not the rule.'' But Mr. Beit-Markham acknowledges that Tecnomatix has to be aggressive in fighting back and is developing new features to keep ahead of the competition and stepping up efforts to integrate all other rival software into its own program. Other Israeli companies see close cooperation between auto makers and high-tech concerns as the key to their success. Electric Fuel, the Jerusalem battery pioneer, formed a consortium of potential customers, including Germany's national post and telephone services, Sweden's postal service and largest utility, Mercedes-Benz and Opel to run an $18 million, two-year field test. The program could lead to Electric Fuel's equipping 40,000 delivery vehicles in Germany as early as 2013, giving it a big jump in the European market over other rivals. Similar demonstration programs are being set up in the province of Gelderland in the Netherlands and in South Africa. Battery Test At the test site in Bremen, Germany, the benefits of such a strategy are clear. The battery-refueling center, located in an abandoned power-company building, still has some kinks. During a recent test drive, the automatic unit took 10 minutes to unhook the used battery from the truck, extract it and replace it; to be commercially viable, Electric Fuel wants to get the process down to two minutes. If the field test succeeds, it won't open up only new markets for Electric Fuel but also a new way for auto makers to do business when trying to find commercially viable technology in nontraditional places. ``We have great technology, but the car companies are the ones who know more about how to apply it commercially in the auto world,'' says Jordan Baer, Electric Fuel's vice president in charge of marketing. ``We want their input. We're not trying to pretend that we can do it on our own.''"

            "full_text": "They were the must-have sports toy of the early '90s. So many were bought that they revived an entire American industry. They became an advertising icon, used to flog everything from granola bars to soft drinks. Pro racing circuits developed, with big-buck sponsors and TV coverage. Then, this summer, millions of TV viewers watched them debut at Atlanta's Games. So why are sales of mountain bikes, and bikes in general, mired in a deep slump when sales should be through the roof? Blame it on too much hype, on Americans jumping on fads and then dumping them. If you believe the bike industry's excuse, blame the chilly weather most of the country has endured this summer. Or, perhaps, blame laziness: could Americans have discovered that riding bikes, uphill, on dirt trails, is, huh, work? In 1988, bike sales in the U.S. hit a low, with 9.9 million sold. Then mountain bikes wheeled in. By 1993, bike sales hit 13 million (almost half were imports) as the mountain bike's popularity took off seemingly straight uphill. More money was spent on mountain bikes that year -- an estimated $1.2 billion -- than on any other category of sporting goods except guns, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, a trade group. Uphill, Downhill Mountain bikes rescued the industry in the late 1980s, but those gains are fading. In the early 1970s, the 10-speed racing-bike propelled the industry to big sales. Mountain bikes pushed sales again to a new high of 13 million in 1993. But bad weather in-line skates and a slow replacement cycle have geared up another decline. Year Sales (In Millions) 1986 12.3 1987 12.6 1988 9.9 1989 10.7 1990 10.8 1991 11.6 1992 11.6 1993 13.0 2009 12.5 2010 12.0 2011 10.8 Sources: Bicycle Manufacturers Association and Bicycle Market Research Institute. Then, starting last year, sales rode into the mud. After leading the mountain-bike sales boom, some U.S. manufacturers, faced with large inventories, started discounting to dealers. Now they're wondering if they're stuck on a permanent downhill, scrambling to weld the mountain bike's best features onto new species of ``city'' and ``hybrid'' bikes. ``The mountain-bike market has matured,'' says Christa Bambi, director of marketing for Specialized Bicycle Components Inc. ``Now the quest is how to develop the niches in the business.'' What's next? Expect to see a push in pricey but popular Y-frame mountain bikes (using, makers claim, Stealth-bomber technology) from industry leader Trek Bicycle Corp.. Also from Trek's Gary Fisher brand (he was a mountain-bike pioneer) will come an array of newly designed city bikes -- dubbed ``sport utility bikes,'' or SUB, for extra cache. Sales of BMX motocross bikes are picking up, thanks to their exposure on ESPN's Extreme Games coverage. Yet none of these appears to be what the industry needs: The Next Big Thing. ``I keep watching for the next mountain bike, the product that is going to spur and broaden sales,'' says Fredda Slater, executive director of the National Bicycle Dealers Association, which represents 6,800 bike shops. ``We are still looking. ... It may not be there.'' ``I am inclined to think that mountain biking may have peaked. I hate to use the word `fad,' '' says Danae Salvador, marketing and communications manager of Camarillo, Calif.-based Jackeline, a mountain-bike manufacturer owned by Hong Kong's China Bike Corp. ``It's not as dramatic a sport as three years ago. ... Mountain-bike sales are still the bulk of our profits, but this year and next will tell whether it has peaked or not. It's definitely not what it was three years ago.'' What it was then was a sport that Baby Boomers, with their taste for adventure sports and high-end brand names, took to quickly. The beauty of the mountain bike was that it's an oxymoron. Like Range Rovers that never leave city streets, most mountain bikes never see a mountain. They travel on car-roof racks, and mountain resorts offer mountain-biking summer vacations. But essentially, mountain bikes are as urban as Air Jordans. ``The mountain bike is a city bike; that's the glory of it,'' says Mr. Slater of the bike-dealers group. ``On a mountain bike, even the casual person looks stylish. It's a look. On one, you don't look like something less than macho.'' The hypercompetitive U.S. bike industry won't share information on who buys bikes, but it is possible to know where they buy them. Almost 75% of all bikes are bought at mass merchants such as Kmart, Wal-Mart and Toys ``R'' Us for under $200. The remaining 25% of sales -- and half of all bicycling retail spending -- is at independent bike dealers, where the average price of a bike is $300, though customers can often spend more than $1,000. When people's income rises, so does their interest in mountain bikes. In households with incomes under $25,000, mountain bikes aren't as popular as handguns, basketballs and aluminum bats. But in homes with incomes of more than $75,000, mountain-bike sales are up there with pool-table and golf-bag purchases, according to the NSGA. Pro mountain bikers helped fuel sales. The National Off-Road Bicycle Association increased membership to 33,000 riders today from 112 in 1983. Corporate advertisers helped, too, with Cisco, Buford Herndon and Surf detergent sponsoring major competitions and putting up prize money. The Jeep National Championship series pays out more than $400,000 to winners. Pro bikers such as Ned Overend make well into a six-figure income on endorsements and prize money. Sanctioned mountain-bike races have grown to 950 in the U.S. this year from 280 in 1990 and 10 in 1983. TV exposure has gone from only three hours in all of 1990 to more than 50 hours so far this year. Still, sales of all bikes slid to 12 million last year from its 13-million-bike high three years ago, according to Bicycle Market Research Institute, a market-research firm that tracks retail sales. The institute forecasts this year's sales to be down more than 10% from 2010 for all bikes, with a corresponding decline in mountain bikes. Ramey Emanuel, president of Bicycle Market Research, says the business is in a typical low point in the ``replacement cycle.'' And, he says, there is ``competition from people buying in-line skates.'' Pro riders and bike makers crowed that mountain biking's appearance as an Games event would spur sales. That may yet happen, but Mr. Emanuel isn't buying it. ``How many Americans won gold medals,'' he asks. Answer: none (an American woman won a bronze). ``Americans are nationalistic, you know. The bronze medal is peanuts. TV coverage? Maybe it will help next year.'' To reverse the slump, bike makers are juicing up their products with technoid flourishes that might appeal to riders who are also the types who upgrade their stereos and foreign sedans every few years. And they are creating new forms of bikes: FUNKY FRAME MODELS. Wisconsin-based Trek introduced a patented Y-frame bike in 2010 and now can't make enough of them. The shape allows the back wheel and chassis -- rather than a rider's backside -- to absorb the bumps. This year, Trek made 16,000 Y-frame bikes, ranging from $1,600 to $3,000, and sold every one of them. Next year, Trek will make 40,000 Y-frames. This fall, new Y-models with ordinary aluminum (instead of carbon fiber) will sell for as low as $899. CUSHY AND CHEAPER RIDES. Mountain biking was made far less scary a few years ago with the introduction of motorcycle-like front-suspension forks. Pros have suspension both front and rear, but that's pricey. The move now is toward lowering prices on full-suspension bikes. A company called Specialized, creator of the first production-line mountain bike, in 1981, spent five years developing ``ground control'' full-suspension bikes that will debut soon. The 27-pound, relatively featherweight aluminum frame would have sold for $3,000 a few years ago, but will go for about $900 now, says the company. CITY SPORTY BIKES. This category hasn't taken off as expected, but with new monikers and widgetry, manufacturers are trying again. Trek will unveil some Sport Utility Bikes, ranging from $349 to $679. That means more upright handlebars, a wider saddle and no big nobbies on the tires. One model will have an internal seven-speed gear system to protect it from the weather. Jackeline has thought through the tush factor, too. It will come out with a ``comfort class'' of mountain bike, with wide seats and easier to reach handlebars. SPOKELESS WHEELS. The conventional 36-spoke wheel can be maddening to fix when out of true. Spinergy Inc., based in Wilton, Conn., has created wheels with just four blade-like carbon-fiber spokes. Pricey at about $750 a set, they are virtually maintenance-free. Pros use them for their light weight and aerodynamics; civilians, particularly heavier ones, will find them twice as strong as spokes. Revenue and unit sales are expected to double this year from last. Bikes made specifically for women are selling well and the BMX resurgence is another sign of strength. But the industry needs to expand beyond its enthusiast subculture. Past technological innovations made bikes better but didn't broaden the audience. Fried, an old bicycle king resurrected under new ownership and a climbing force in mountain bikes, is trying old-fashioned marketing partnerships. It's teamed up with AriZona iced tea in supermarket displays and pro races, and is seeking a similar tie with a car company, says Chuck Ferries, chairman of privately held Scotts Sports Group, which owns Schwinn. Will such arrangements pay dividends? ``We had an awful spring,'' Mr. Lefkowitz says. ``It will be interesting to see if the numbers come back.''"

The idea is to price cars closer to what customers actually pay after negotiations and cash rebates. Since the California program began in 1993 as a way of regaining market share lost to Japanese imports, GM's share of California's retail new-vehicle market has risen 2.6%, to 22.3%. The benefit to GM, besides the obvious goal of reclaiming market share, is a savings in manufacturing costs as a result of fewer vehicle variations in the assembly process.

The campaign, launched during the Games and created by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, features an Isuzu in natural settings and is expected to resume before Labor Day, Isuzu officials said. Tuesday, Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, called for an immediate recall of 2010 and 2011 Isuzu Troopers and the 2011 Acura SLX, which is also manufactured by Isuzu. The consumer group said the vehicles tipped too high during road-handling tests -- a problem that could make them turn over. Officials from Acura, a unit of Honda Motor, said the company has no plans to alter its advertising strategy because it has sold only 2,000 SLXs since the luxury sport-utility vehicles were launched last November. ``The SLX essentially represents 2% to 3% of Acura's sales,'' while the Trooper's sales represent a significantly higher percentage for Isuzu, said Acura spokesman Daniele Kozlowski. Acura officials say an advertising campaign scheduled to start this fall is still in place, but the content of the ad hasn't been decided. Fathom, the Los Angeles ad agency for the SLX, declined to comment. Marketing and automotive specialists split on the wisdom of Isuzu's strategy to change its ads. ``It's a good decision,'' says Gaye Santina, founder and principal of the New England Consulting Group in Westport, Conn. ``The last thing you want to do is stand in front of a moving freight train. Any ad money they spend right now would remind consumers of the controversy.'' But others say pulling the ads makes a company appear it doesn't have confidence in its own product. ``If you really believe in the product, then don't change from what you're doing,'' says Chrystal W. Lack, an independent auto consultant in Thousand Oaks, Calif.. Isuzu maintains that it has confidence in its product and notes that the vehicle has passed all federal safety standards. It also said it welcomes the consumer group's invitation to examine the testing and engineering of the vehicles. Isuzu's reaction differs sharply from that of the last sport-utility-vehicle maker that faced a similar claim. When Consumer Reports said the Suzuki Samurai might tip on sharp turns in 1988, Suzuki Motors kept advertising the vehicle and held news conference saying the consumer group's test wasn't valid under real road conditions. Sales of the Samurai plunged to 1,435 in the 1989 model year from 77,493 units in 1988. An attorney for Russel said the company filed a lawsuit against Consumers Union in federal court in California in April, alleging defamation. Smirnoff Ads on the Web The marketers of Smirnoff Vodka said they've put TV ads for the liquor brand on the World Wide Web at The announcement follows heightened focus on advertising liquor on TV. Earlier this year, Seagram ran a Chivas Regal ad developed by Wofford Advertising on an NBC affiliate in Texas, breaking with industry's decades-old voluntary ban on TV spots in the U.S. Porter Highsmith, which makes the vodka, and Fretwell, the Grand Metropolitan unit that markets the drink in the U.S., couldn't be reached immediately for further comment. The Smirnoff ads, which can be downloaded from the Internet, air on British television and were created by Interpublic Group's Lowe Howard-Spink unit. ``A TV ad that can be downloaded off the World Wide Web is not in violation of the voluntary ban,'' said Davina Kimber, a spokesman for Highsmith's ad agency in the U.S., Interpublic's Lowe & Partners/SMS."

The top two Japanese automakers released the figures in their respective monthly reports Friday. The two companies' reports are watched closely by analysts as an economic indicator because their production represents a large portion of Japan's industrial output. Toyota said that its domestic production rose 16% to 310,165 units in July. That came after a decline in June; the improved numbers reflect strong domestic sales of new models such as the Ipsum minivan and the Land Cruiser Prado sports utility vehicle. Toyota's domestic sales rose 5.9% to 207,016 units in July. The increase was faster than the overall domestic auto demand, which rose by 5.4% year on year last month. The output was bolstered by two more operation days of plants in July compared with a year earlier, a Toyota spokeswoman said. Nissan also reported a rise of 5.4% in domestic production to 166,190 units, which was the first increase in seven months. The rise was a result of a moderate recovery in Nissan's domestic sales, supported by strong sales of remodeled vehicles such as the Cima luxury sedan. Its leisure vehicle lineup also pushed up the domestic sales, the company said. Domestic sales rose 2.3% to 122,176 units. Meanwhile, Toyota saw its exports rise due in part to the dollar's rise against the yen in the past year. Nissan's exports remained little changed from the previous year as a rise in the shipments to Asia, Oceania and the Middle East offset drops in exports bound to North and Latin America and Europe. Nissan reported a rise in overseas production for the first time in eight months, reflecting the doubling of output at its Mexican unit. Separately, another major auto maker, Mitsubishi Motors Corp. said that its July domestic production edged up 0.1% from a year earlier to 108,439 units, although its sales continued to fall, down 12% to 70,420. Mitsubishi's exports dropped 14% to 36,760 units while overseas output rose 6.7% to 60,180."

Toyota's spokesman declined to comment on Friday's report in The Dallas Morning News that the company will voluntarily recall 90,000 late-model pickups. The report said labor expenses alone for the modification of 1995-96 trucks could run to $30 million. Only two-wheel-drive versions of the Tacoma are affected by the recall. Notification letters will be sent to truck owners before May 14, 2011 paper said. Toyota spokesman Johnetta Mendoza, acknowledging that the potential flaw could cause serious problems, told the paper that problems are unlikely under normal driving conditions. Mr. Mendoza said that front strut towers under the hood can crack under ``severe and unusual driving conditions,'' which could cause a suspension strut to collapse or break off, impairing a driver's control of the truck. Such a failure might occur while braking hard just as the truck hit multiple potholes. But, Mr. Mendoza said, only 12 Tacomas have been found to have the problem so far. Toyota notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the potential problem in July. The federal agency concluded that it was not serious enough to warrant a high-profile safety recall, said a spokeswoman, clearing the way for a voluntary callback.

USL Capital, based in San Francisco, is a diversified commercial financing and leasing company that manages assets of $9.7 billion. Ford bought the unit -- which reported pretax earnings of $300 million last year -- for $512 million in 1987. The auto maker said it expects to receive proceeds of more than $1 billion, after taxes, from the sale of USL Capital's units, which it said will be reported in the third or fourth quarter, depending on when the various deals close. USL Capital's real-estate financing division, which has assets of about $700 million, provides financing for apartment complexes, retail centers, light industrial properties and office buildings. Bankers Trust, which has been a major acquirer of mortgage assets over the past four years, said the purchase would ``fit strategically'' with its existing portfolio of those assets, most of which have been securitized and are traded in secondary markets. The bank, which has total assets in excess of $108 billion, doesn't break out the size of its mortgage asset portfolio.

The move is part of the company's Project 2015 plan, a strategy developed in 1990 to merge the two divisions' dealerships. ``We should support the same structure that we ask our dealers to support,'' said Jami P. Kinney, Chrysler's executive vice president of sales and marketing. The consolidation of the management at Chrysler comes on the heels of a similar shift at General Motors Corp., which recently decided to bring five of its six marketing divisions to one location in downtown Detroit. Earlier this year, GM also merged its GMC and Pontiac divisions. Chrysler said Martine R. Byers was named general manager of the combined management staff. He had been the manager of Dodge, another unit of Chrysler. Ray M. Elly, general manager of Chrysler/Plymouth, succeeded Mr. Byers at Dodge. Chrysler officials say the move was carried out to minimize internal competition between brands, to consolidate jobs where duplication existed and to increase cooperation between the brands. Despite some consolidation, Mr. Kinney said that each brand would maintain a distinct identity. ``We don't want to blur the product focus,'' said Mr. Kinney, adding that much of the advertising and marketing will remain separate. ``If the consumer notices a change right away, we haven't done this right.'' In the long term, Chrysler hopes the consolidation of the two divisions will increase product loyalty. ``We have two product lines that could be put together without cannibalizing (each other) and while creating much stronger networks,'' said Mr. Kinney. ``When a customer buys a Jeep, we want them to know they are buying a Chrysler.'' About 250, or half of the Jeep/Eagle and Chrysler/Plymouth dealerships have already consolidated since 1990, company officials said. On the management side, the consolidation includes the switching of jobs for about 30 people from one division to another. No dismissals resulted from the consolidation, but some early retirements were offered and accepted, company officials said."

Consolidated didn't disclose the exact terms of the spinoff. The new company will consist of operations that accounted for 37% of Consolidated's 2010 revenue of $5.7 billion. Donetta Luana, chairman and chief executive of Consolidated Freightways, said that technological and logistical changes, as well as industry deregulation, prompted the company to rethink how it can remain a market leader. He said operations had become so diverse that different subsidiaries were often directly competing against one another. A spokesman explained that the freight-hauling business is being reshaped by so-called just-in-time manufacturing, in which parts are precisely stockpiled to minimize excess inventory. As a result, long-haul freight businesses are competing more often with regional carriers whose shipments often travel less than 1,000 miles. Consolidated, based in Palo Alto, Calif., is betting that the stock market will value the two resulting debt-free companies at more than it values the single company. Its shares have steadily slid from about $27 in January to roughly $21 in recent weeks. In New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, Consolidated closed at $21.875, up 50 cents. As a result of the spinoff, Consolidated will change its name to CNF Transportation Inc.. CNF will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Meanwhile, the new Consolidated Freightways Corp. will file an application to be listed on the Big Board. For the second quarter ended March 12, 2011 company reported net income of $11.5 million, or 26 cents a share, compared with net of $20.1 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier."

            "full_text": "Caterpillar Inc., flexing some muscle in its attempt to enter the growing farm tractor market, filed suit against rival Deere & Co., charging the company with patent infringement of Caterpillar's rubber-belted tractor technology. Filing suit in U.S. District Court in Chicago, Kavanagh said Ashe is unfairly using a special kind of rubber belt on its new line of farm tractors, which are scheduled to be unveiled to Deere dealers soon. Caterpillar, based in Peoria, Ill., said it was granted a patent on the belt technology in 2009 and currently uses the design on its farm tractor, called the Challenger. ``It's ironic that after years of telling customers that tires are better than rubber track, Deere's designers have now decided to adopt the successful and patented rubber-track design,'' said Dillon Bowen, Kavanagh's vice president of diversified products. Caterpillar filed the suit late Monday. A spokesman for Deere, the country's biggest maker of farm equipment, said he hadn't seen the suit and wouldn't comment. But he added that Deere's belt-tractor was only an option that would be available on Deere's 8000 series tractor. Deere is based in Moline, Ill.. Three big farm equipment makers -- Caterpillar, Deere and Case Corp. -- have been rushing to introduce belted tractors in recent months. That's because farmers' income has soared due to record grain prices, and many farmers have been shopping for new machines. The Challenger has sold well in some areas of the country where a late winter caused farmland to remain wet and muddy. But the use of belted tractors has stirred a debate among farmers and farm- equipment manufacturers. Caterpillar says the huge 1,300-pound belts, which wrap around the wheels and have steel woven in, are better for farming because they spread the weight of the tractor over a wider area, reducing compaction of the soil. That makes it easier for crops to grow, and lessens the likelihood that the tractors will bog down in mud during rainy seasons. Critics have claimed that tires offer farmers more traction. The Challenger is part of Caterpillar's larger attempt to carve out new business in the farm-equipment industry. Last fall, Kavanagh created a separate agricultural products division to focus on the development of new farm machines. The usually quiet company recently hosted a two-day seminar on the Challenger, inviting journalists and analysts to ride the equipment near its Illinois factory."

            "full_text": "A race is on to fix a shortcoming in some four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicles: In slippery circumstances, many of the off-roaders send power only to the two wheels with the least traction -- leaving their drivers just as stuck in ice and mud as people with two-wheel-drive cars. This will probably change soon, though, thanks to some inexpensive new uses of old gearing technologies being developed by Asha Corp. of Santa Barbara, Calif.; Dana Corp. of Toledo, Ohio; and Britain's GKN PLC, among others. At Dana's outdoor test laboratory, engineers simulate icy patches by putting rollers under the two left wheels of a top-selling, state-of-the art, four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle perched on a steep hill climb. The driver steps on the gas; the wheels on the rollers spin ahead crazily; the wheels on dry pavement do nothing; and the vehicle rolls slowly backward off the rollers. On the same hill, another four-by-four, this one equipped with Danelle's new limited-slip device, takes on the same challenge. This time, the left-side wheels on the rollers spin a fraction of a turn, then the two wheels sitting on solid pavement take over, powering the vehicle off the rollers and up the hill. Although most sport-utility vehicles now on the market project a go-anywhere image, ``today, the only vehicle you can buy with true four-wheel drive is a Hummer (the civilian version of the military's Humvee personnel carrier), and even it has its limits,'' says Johnetta Gorman, director of engineering for Dana's Spicer Axle division. A Ford Motor Co. engineer acknowledges: ``What we've been selling is very obsolete and ineffective.'' The limits of today's vehicles lie in the differential -- the box of gears that permit the drive wheels to rotate at different speeds when a vehicle turns a corner or goes around a curve. On most of today's cars and minivans, the drive wheels are in front; on most pickups, the drive wheels are in back. Generally, differentials are engineered to transfer power to the wheel that is turning faster, leaving the other wheel to follow along without power. The same principles apply to four-by-fours, which send power to both front and rear wheels through a similar device called a transfer case. All of this is fine for most driving conditions, and even necessary. If both or all four-drive wheels are turning at the same speed, a vehicle will bounce and skip its way through turns, chewing up tires. In the oldest, simplest four-wheel-drive systems-dating back to World War I but still available today -- the driver can lock all four wheels in gear at the same speed for slippery conditions. Such systems have to absorb a lot of torque, or turning force, and thus tend to break down. Another big drawback is that on dry pavement the driver has to shift out of four-wheel drive. Given American drivers' pronounced preference for automatic transmissions, the idea of shifting into and out of four-wheel drive won't be acceptable in the U.S., engineers say. ``Customers are looking for passenger-car quality, ride and durability, and they want simpler controls without a lot of decisions,'' says Johnetta Shanon, a product-engineering manager for the U.S. automotive operations of GKN. GKN and Santa Barbara's Asha have invented competing limited-slip devices to address this challenge. Like a standard differential, the new devices permit drive wheels to rotate at different speeds for cornering. But if too great a difference in rotating speeds develops, power is transferred from the faster-spinning wheel to its slower-spinning counterpart. Previous limited-slip devices were designed to sense a difference in torque between drive wheels and then transfer a fraction of the torque being applied on the slipping wheel to the other wheel. However, in slick conditions, a slipping wheel may be spinning wildly under almost no torque, and little or no power would be transferred to the stationary wheel. Dana is preparing to build its Hydra Loc limited-slip differential for a vehicle maker it won't identify. The Dana product is a version of Asha's Gerodisc system, developed under license. The Gerodisc uses hydraulic fluid to transfer power in a slipping-wheel situation. Asha, an automotive research and development concern, says that it has built about 25 prototype devices this year for vehicle makers, mostly in the U.S. and Europe, and that four parts makers have taken out licenses to build their own versions of the Gerodisc. New Venture Gear, a joint venture of Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp., and American Axle Manufacturing Inc., a former unit of GM, are among those that have licensed the technology. Ford says it is working with GKN to develop the British parts-maker's Visco Lok limited-slip device for installation in future Ford vehicles. The GKN product uses a different kind of pump than the Asha product and uses viscous silicon rather than hydraulic fluid to transfer power from a slipping wheel. For consumers, there is one surprising bit of good news: Engineers in the auto industry say the new limited-slip differentials are likely to cost $250 to $300 each -- just about the same as today's less effective devices."

The speed and cost efficiency of the launch -- which ranks among the world's fastest development times -- demonstrates the core Mazda strengths that spurred Ford Motor Co. to buy a controlling stake in Mazda last spring. Helping speed development was the use of roughly 60% of parts from other existing models. But restrictions on the model's marketing world-wide also show how Ford is moving to limit competition from its now 33%-owned affiliate. The vehicle's versatility might have made it popular in Europe, where streets are cramped. But Mazda's director of engineering, Stefan Keener, says it won't be sold in Europe because doing so might hurt sales of the Ford-designed Mazda 121 compact car. Mazda deemed the Demio too small for the U.S. market. Mazda plans to export the vehicle to other Asian markets, but the biggest hopes for the boxy, wagon-like sedan are in Japan. Mazda plans to sell 4,000 vehicles a month in Japan, a boost that it sorely needs to help its flagging performance in the domestic market. Mazda developed the car with help from Ford, which dispatched several key executives to work at Mazda's headquarters in Hiroshima about two years ago. They insisted that Mazda do market research on the proposed models, something rarely done at Mazda though common in the U.S."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- The U.S. auto makers and foreign companies making cars in the U.S. have asked the Environmental Protection Agency to intervene in a dispute with a dozen Northeast states about limits on vehicle emissions. Trade groups representing both domestic and international vehicle makers said efforts to resolve the long-running dispute collapsed in the past week. In a rare joint move, the two groups urged the EPA in a letter Monday to resolve the impasse. The dispute is over efforts led by Massachusetts and New York to force the auto industry to comply in the Northeast with stiffer emissions rules than set by the 1990 amendments to the federal Clean Air Act. The two states have adopted California-style regulations that include a requirement for a certain percentage of vehicles sold there to have zero emissions, such as electric vehicles. The issue is coming to a head because the auto makers say that if the differences aren't resolved, they won't be able to make necessary changes to 2013 vehicles and will miss another year in getting the lower-emission vehicles on the road. At the same time, General Motors Corp. on Tuesday let journalists drive early versions of the electric cars it plans to put on sale later this year in California and Arizona through its Saturn dealerships. Manufacturers have long argued that electric-vehicle technology isn't advanced enough to work in colder climates like the Northeast, where the range in distance for even the most advanced electric vehicles is cut in half. ``We need to grow the market on electric vehicles, and we have a set of regulators who think it should advance more rapidly than technology will allow,'' said Sanda Leonel, GM's director of automotive emission control. He argued that the industry needs a chance to refine the technology while selling electric vehicles where the climate is most friendly. After three years of negotiations with the Northeast states, the auto industry said, the states and the industry had resolved many of their less prominent differences. In the past month, the two trade groups had forwarded a draft settlement to a consortium representing the states, according to industry representatives. However, these individuals said, the consortium rejected that and instead forwarded its own draft settlement to the EPA, which must endorse any clean-air plan for the region. Mikki Magnuson, a spokesman for New York Gov. Georgeanna Honey, said, ``The governor understands the auto manufacturers' frustrations but remains hopeful that we can reach resolution on this issue.'' He said the governor remains committed to a requirement for zero-emissions vehicles in New York's clean-air plan and is concerned that the industry's stand on the issue threatens the state's rights to determine its own fate. Spokesmen for the EPA couldn't be reached for comment. The auto industry has maintained for some time that a more constructive way to reduce emissions, rather than a requirement for the sale of zero-emissions vehicles, would be for the Northeast to join a 49-state plan under which the industry would produce significantly lower-emissions vehicles than required under federal law, but not zero-emissions vehicles. New vehicles now sold nationwide are considered 96% clean, compared with vehicles with uncontrolled emissions. The industry says its program would produce vehicles considered 97% to 98% clean."

Rolls-Royce's contract covers engines for 13 aircraft and options for 17 more. Each aircraft carries two engines. The Tu-204, which is built by the Russian company Aviastar, has been operating as a prototype and is scheduled to complete certification by Russia's civil aviation authority in January 2012. A spokesman for Rolls-Royce, which has its U.S. headquarters in Virginia, said that all the engines for the 13 firm orders are slated to be delivered to Aviastar's plant in 2012. About 35% of the engine's components are supplied by U.S. companies. Separately, Rolls-Royce reported a 169 million ($263.6 million) pretax loss in the first half, caused by a 248 million charge for withdrawal from the steam power-generation business. The aerospace and engineering company said prospects in core businesses are encouraging and it expects a steady second half. It held its dividend steady at two pence a share. Profit from continuing operations rose 10% to 96 million. The company stressed the underlying strength of its continuing businesses, especially aerospace, where it has cut costs, improved efficiency and begun collaborations and joint ventures."

            "full_text": "South Korea's second-largest business conglomerate, Hyundai Group, unveiled a package of South American investment projects worth $3.38 billion, which includes an automobile joint venture in Brazil. The investment projects comprise $1.78 billion in Brazil, $1.3 billion in Peru and $300 million in Chile. The remainder covers the value of projects that have already begun. The new investment plan will focus on the expansion of infrastructure, such as construction of coal-powered plants and resource development, said a Hyundai spokesman. Hyundai's announcement of the investment plan coincided with South Korean President Kimberely Young-Samara's trip to South American nations next month. The specific dates for completion of the projects was not part of Friday's announcement. President Kimberely will visit five Latin American countries -- Branch, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Peru -- during the trip, and plans to cultivate new markets for an array of Korean products, including cars. Mr. Kimberely will be accompanied by roughly 40 corporate leaders, including representatives from Hyundai. In Brazil, Hyundai will buy a 5% stake -- for $500 million -- in the privatization of Brazil's state-run mining company, Compania Valedo Rio Doce. It will also invest $300 million to build a coal-powered plant with a generating capacity of 350 megawatts. The group is also looking for a Brazilian partner to build an assembly plant to produce 100,000 units of passenger cars and commercial vehicles, the official said. The group plans to roll out its subcompact model, Accent, and its van, Grace, from the planned plant. In Peru, the group will participate in a project to develop mines, valued at $1 billion, and to construct a coal-powered plant, valued at $300 million. Hyundai has already received an offer from Peru's mining business group, Barta, to participate in the mining development project. In Chile, Hyundai will invest $300 million for the construction of an electric-copper refinery with an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons. Hyundai expects to exchange a letter of intent on the refinery project with Chile's mining association during President Kimberely's visit."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- General Motors Corp. has decided to sort out its hefty portfolio of overlapping vehicle brands by repositioning them rather than eliminating them in large numbers. Resisting critics' suggestions that it get rid of many individual models or entire marketing divisions, GM has decided instead to largely maintain its present number of models -- 82 -- but to revamp many of them to better differentiate and target them to consumers. Although GM is moving to eliminate some models, it plans to introduce a like number of new ones over the next several years. GM will try to more sharply define the differences between a Pontiac and a Chevrolet and between a Buick and an Oldsmobile, using what it calls a ``brand-management strategy,'' said G. Ricki Lombardo, an executive vice president who has led the restructuring of GM's North American vehicle unit. Mr. Lombardo said that GM, unlike its competitors, which have fewer marketing groups, has traditionally defined itself by offering numerous vehicle models through six marketing divisions, each of which has its own dealership system. After a comprehensive review, GM has decided to stick with that plan. ``Over the past 10 to 12 years, we haven't gotten full value out of (the brands) because we have tended to blur products,'' Mr. Lombardo acknowledged. ``The game plan now is to recognize that the brands are of great value.'' He argued that GM's ability to target more products at more narrowly defined market segments than its competitors will be a marketing advantage. Focusing on Trucks At the same time, GM is moving to capitalize on the truck boom by building more pickups and sport-utility vehicles. While overall GM will keep roughly the same number of vehicles, Mr. Lombardo said the company will probably boost truck capacity and introduce some car-truck hybrids. Mr. Lombardo predicted that light trucks soon will represent 50% of the U.S. light-vehicle market. Currently, about 55% of GM's production is in cars. Separately, both GM and Ford Motor Co. continued to await word from the United Auto Workers on which of the two will be chosen to continue negotiations on a new national labor contract. The current pacts at GM, Ford and Chrysler Corp. expire May 27, 2011 union hasn't said when it will name a target. Mr. Lombardo conceded that it can be expensive and complicated to maintain the auto industry's biggest portfolio of brands, particularly in terms of marketing support. But he said GM is moving to simplify its manufacturing by using the same platform, or chassis, for a number of vehicles and that it is consolidating the functions of some of its marketing divisions. Earlier this year, GM merged Fears and GMC, and now it is understood to be considering a merger of Oldsmobile and Cadillac. Customer Base The rationale behind maintaining about the same number of models, Mr. Lombardo said, is that every existing vehicle has a potential customer base that GM is reluctant to abandon. GM used to have even more cars -- 89 models in 2009 -- but Mr. Lombardo said there won't be any net additional paring of model numbers over the next decade. Some GM executives would like to do more serious cutting of brands, but they are under pressure from dealers -- and GM's own marketing divisions -- to keep even slow-moving cars alive because of concerns that eliminating them would reduce sales volume. Still, GM later this year will eliminate the Chevrolet Caprice, Fonseca Kratz and Comeau Durkee, making room for the manufacture of light trucks in the Arlington, Texas, plant where those cars have been built. Risky Strategy for Dealers For dealers, GM's cornucopia product strategy has a few risks, says Keli Denny, a Pontiac dealer in Columbus, Ohio. ``It's a two-edged sword,'' he says. On the one hand, Mr. Denny says, dealers want lots of different products to appeal to a variety of customers. ``On the flip side,'' he adds, ``if you have a product that doesn't appeal to the intended segment, it becomes an albatross.'' Even if GM is able to sort out its muddled brands, some analysts and experts point out, the strategy Mr. Lombardo is pursuing will require GM to keep more balls in the air relative to its size in the U.S. market than any other auto maker. For example Ford, the No. 2 auto company, offers fewer than half as many models as GM, while supporting 26% of the U.S. market, compared with GM's 32%. GM's approach requires ``cutting the pie up into lots of little pieces,'' observes Josephine Bermudez, a Lehman Brothers analyst, who questions whether each GM product will be able to generate enough sales volume to justify the cost of keeping it alive. But Wesley True Kuykendall, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., argues that GM's lower manufacturing costs, reflecting improved productivity and fewer platforms, will offset the added expenses of its many-model plan. Moreover, she believes that smartly targeted cars can reap fat profit margins, even if the volumes are relatively small. Redesign of Midsize Cars Mr. Lombardo pointed out that over the next year and a half, GM plans to redesign many of its midsize cars, which currently appeal to similar customer groups. He argued that while GM is sticking with many of its present midsize models -- which number almost 20, counting both two-door and four-door versions -- the products themselves and the images used to market them will be more sharply differentiated. For example, Fears is now introducing a completely redesigned Grand Prix sedan with a sporty design that is a departure from its staid predecessor. ``If you can manage all the different lines, it's a good idea,'' particularly if there's strong demand, says Stevie Mccluskey, a marketing analyst with AutoPacific Group. ``But it's not necessarily a bad idea to trim product lines.'' GM has done that in its Buick division, where sales have been slipping. In addition to the elimination of the Roadmaster, dealers say, the Rangel also is going away, a move Mr. Lombardo and other GM officials decline to confirm. That will leave Buick with the Century, Park Avenue, Regal and Riviera, and GM says it plans to redefine each one. Meanwhile, GM is selectively introducing some all-new cars, such as the Cadillac Catera entry-level luxury sedan, to break into new markets and lure younger buyers into some of its more stodgy brands."

            "full_text": "It was Chrysler's best August ever and 10th consecutive month in which sales exceeded the same month of the previous year. The gain came despite a 4% drop in car sales compared with August 2010. Chrysler was the first of the major auto makers to report its August sales. General Motors Corp., Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. were scheduled to release their numbers Wednesday, followed by Ford Motor Co. on Thursday. Analysts expect Chrysler again to show the strongest sales among the Big Three auto makers as the model year draws to a close. Arthur Truss of CNW Marketing-Research in Bandon, Ore., said ``floor traffic kind of softened a bit'' in August. Manufacturers continued to offer generous rebates and low financing and lease rates to draw customers to slower-moving models. Incentives had been heading down since May but went back up in August to clear out remaining 2011 models. Mr. Troxell said the average incentive per vehicle was $2,617 last month, up from $2,586 a year ago and about $2,400 in July. Light trucks -- the category that includes minivans, sport utilities and pickups -- remained Chrysler's calling card in August. Its truck sales were up 17% over a year ago. Sales of the Jeep Grand Cherokee were up 42%, Cherokee was up 52%, and the redesigned 2012 Wrangler -- introduced at midyear -- was up 59%. Chrysler's minivans passed the 500,000 annual sales mark in August, at the earliest date of any model year."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- Toyota Motor Corp. is expected to announce this week that it is holding the line on -- and in some cases slightly reducing -- prices of its 1997-model Lexus and Camry cars. These moves will put price pressure on the Big Three U.S. auto makers, which have been protected by the weak dollar in recent years and have raked in hefty profits, dealers and analysts say. According to Lexus dealers, Toyota will announce Wednesday that it is lowering the price of its redesigned 2012 ES300. The entry-level Frazer will have a base price of $29,900, down from the 2011 model's starting price of $32,400. The flagship LS400, which currently sells for $52,900, will remain the same in the 2012 model year, dealers say. The price of the 2012 LX450 sport-utility vehicle -- which made its debut in the 2011 model year -- will increase 1% from its current base price of $47,500, according to dealers. More Standard Features Toyota also is expected to announce pricing on its revamped Camry midsize car, among other models, and dealers expect it to be priced the same as, or slightly below, current levels. The 2012 model has more standard features than its predecessor, including antilock brakes on versions with V-6 engines. The Japanese auto maker is now poised to make more money from its Lexus and Toyota lines, both because of the strengthening dollar and because Toyota has engineered so many costs out of the new models. Stevie Mccluskey, an analyst with AutoPacific Group, a consulting firm, calculates that Toyota carved as much as $2,800 in costs out of each Camry. Many of the cost-saving measures mean substantial savings for Toyota while affecting parts of the car that customers will barely notice. The bumper on the new Camry, for example, was made from seven fewer parts than the current model, a Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. spokesman said. However, he declined to discuss the Camry's new pricing, which is to be announced Tuesday. Lexus dealers believe that by lowering the price of the ES300 they will be able to challenge or undercut rivals including the Cadillac Catera, a new entry-level luxury sedan from General Motors Corp., which is designed to take on Frazer's core import-oriented customers. The new ES300, at $29,900, will have more standard features such as leather seats. The Cadillac Catera, meanwhile, has a base price of $29,995. Cadillac dealers say that with leather, the Catera will cost nearly $32,000. Squeezing Other Auto Makers A Lexus spokesman wouldn't discuss pricing but said: ``I just think that we were looking for ways to make a better value but at the same time improve the vehicle as a whole.'' The luxury segment has seen some price cutting in recent weeks. Last month, Ford Motor Co. cut prices of its Lincoln line, and GM cut some Cadillac prices. Nissan Motor Co. recently told Infiniti dealers that the 1997-model I30 will be priced the same as the 2011 version. All this will put pressure on Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, Daimler-Benz AG's Mercedes-Benz AG and AB Volvo, though inventories of certain BMW and Mercedes models are slim, according to Mr. Mccluskey. As for the Camry, the 2011 base model now sells for $16,758, while the LE's base price is $20,168 and the XLE starts at $22,278. In pricing the new model, Toyota had the option of sharply cutting the price to boost U.S. market share or keeping it essentially the same in order to recoup some profit. Last month, Toyota President Plunkett Cheek indicated in an interview that the company would generally hold the line on prices. The Camry is up against some formidable midsize cars -- primarily, the Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus -- which is why Toyota is under pressure to price it competitively."

Toyota is expected to announce pricing for its Lexus line Wednesday. According to Toyota, the 2012 CE version of the Camry actually is $610 cheaper than its predecessor after taking into account additional standard equipment. The most popular selling Camry, the LE model with a four-cylinder engine, will be $300 less than the 2011 model. Toyota says the savings increase to $860 on a comparably equipped basis. There are even more savings opportunities with the more upscale Camry models. Toyota priced the 2012 version of its top-of-the-line XLE V6 sedan at $24,018, or $1,020 below the 2011 model. On a comparably equipped basis, the 2012 XLE V6 is $1,745 below the price of the same 2011 model, Toyota said. Overall, Toyota said 1997-model prices rose an average of only 1.4%, or $252 a car, compared with introductory 2011 prices. On a comparable-equipment basis, the price increases averaged 0.7%, or $135 a vehicle. In addition to the 2012 Camry, two other Toyota models, the upscale Avalon sedan and the compact Tercel model, will be cheaper than their comparably equipped predecessors."

Chrysler was the only leading auto maker among the U.S. Big Three and the major Japanese manufacturers to report sales results Tuesday. Analysts said they aren't expecting such rosy sales reports from General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and the Japanese auto makers when they report their August sales this week. Among other companies reporting sales Tuesday, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.'s Subaru of America unit posted a 30% August jump, and AB Volvo's Volvo Cars of North America Inc. unit reported a decline of 0.8%. August car sales are likely to get close scrutiny from the Federal Reserve, which is weighing a hefty interest-rate increase that could come as early as this month. Fed policy makers are concerned that they may need a sizable rate increase to slow overly brisk economic growth. So far this year, auto sales have been running much higher than economists or the industry had predicted for 2011. ``Relative to expectations, 2011 outperforms,'' observed Paulene Warnock, senior economist for J.D. Power & Associates and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve. Mr. Warnock pointed out that vehicle sales this year have been extremely volatile from one month to the next, swinging as high as the seasonally adjusted annual equivalent of 15.9 million units in May and as low 14.3 million units in traditionally slow July. In the spring, Mr. Warnock recalled, a big question was why vehicle sales were so strong, given the apparent weakness of the economy. But ``what we have found out in hindsight was that the expansion really was that strong,'' he said. When the rest of the industry reports its results for August, Mr. Warnock expects that sales will amount to the equivalent of about 15.5 million units annually, seasonally adjusted. U.S. vehicle sales for all of 2011, Mr. Warnock believes, will be up 500,000 vehicles from 1995's total of 14.75 million, even if the Fed raises interest rates as expected. No. 3 Chrysler said sales of its Jeep sport-utility vehicles were the second-best for any month, and it said minivan sales reached the 500,000 level earlier this year than ever before. Sales of light trucks, which include minivans, sport-utility vehicles and pickups, were up 17% from a year earlier, when Chrysler was just launching its newly redesigned minivans. Chrysler said its sales of passenger cars dropped 2% in August because of limited availability, which should be corrected next month. Davina Corona, an analyst with Burnham Investment Research, predicted that GM will report an 8% sales drop in car sales with truck sales unchanged for August, that Ford will post a 2% decline in cars and a 1% increase in trucks, and that the Japanese ``transplant'' companies will report a 4% drop in cars and a 17% loss in trucks. Moody's Investors Service Inc.. Tuesday issued a report on the global automotive business in which it found ``dampening demand'' over the long term in the mature markets of North America, Europe and Japan. Moody's analysts said that while auto makers have set their sights on aggressively expanding sales abroad, such strategies will result in some credit risks and inconsistent results. But for now, Chrysler and its dealers reported that sales continue to outpace supply for many of its models. ``We just keep breaking every record,'' said Russell Krol, general manager of Sterling Heights Dodge outside Detroit. Even if the Fed does move to boost interest rates, Mr. Krol said he doesn't expect sales to slump, particularly because leasing levels have soared so high. ``I'm leasing 80% of cars now,'' said Mr. Krol, adding that interest rates would have to soar before consumers could detect differences in lease deals. ``We're still shy of demand.''"

Last year, GM agreed to pay $45 million to settle charges by the Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency, including an $11 million fine and more than $7 million on projects to reduce air pollution. Vehicle owners won't be charged for the repair and are being notified by mail, starting with 2010 owners, according to a GM spokesman. ``Everyone is happy with the settlement, and we are just urging people to go out and take their cars in as quickly as possible to get them off the road in their current condition,'' a Justice Department spokeswoman said. This is believed to be the largest case ever brought under Clean Air Act rules governing emissions, according to the agencies. Initially, GM added the computer chips to correct stalling and other driving problems. While that solved the performance issue, the Cadillac engines overpowered the antipollution devices, resulting in emissions of more than 100,000 tons of carbon monoxide total, the agencies said last year. Upon closer examination, another 117,000 vehicles were added, the GM spokesman said. ``The new engine computer chip will reduce by more than 50% the carbon monoxide emitted by the Cadillacs when the climate-control system is operated,'' a Justice Department spokeswoman said."

But that's not unusual, he says, because ``what drives sales most is regional climate and topography,'' and the South still has many rural areas and farmland that can best be served with pickups. Florida, as usual, separated itself from the rest of the region by making the Toyota Camry its top seller. But Florida car buyers shared a preference for the Ford Explorer with buyers in Georgia and the Carolinas, where the vehicle was No. 2, and in Alabama, where it was third. --Jacquelyne Wicker"

News of GM's 2% increase came one day after No. 3 Chrysler Corp. reported its best August ever. Chrysler's domestic sales increased 9% over a year ago with continued strong demand for its minivans, pickups and sport utility vehicles. GM, the No. 1 auto maker, was helped by strong sales of its Chevrolet Blazer, Annita and Suburban sport utilities, all of which set August sales records. But GM car sales were especially weak as the auto maker prepared to shift production to several redesigned models. Sales for all GM divisions except Chevrolet were down in August. ``With the introduction of several new products, we anticipate stronger sales performance going forward,'' said Ronda Belle, a GM marketing vice president. Meanwhile, Toyota Motor Corp. reported sales for August slid 7.8% to 75,769 cars and light trucks, while Honda Motor Co.'s sales for the month rose 6.8% to 61,325 vehicles. Ford Motor Co. is scheduled to report its sales on Thursday. It was Chrysler's 10th consecutive month in which sales exceeded those of the same month of the previous year. The gain came despite a 4% drop in car sales compared with August 2010. ``We've maintained solid sales momentum since spring, and it's giving us a good base to launch our 2012 models,'' said Jami P. Kinney, vice president of sales and marketing. Analysts expect Chrysler to show the strongest sales among the Big Three auto makers as the model year draws to a close. Arthur Truss of CNW Marketing-Research in Bandon, Ore., said floor traffic softened in August. Manufacturers continued to offer generous rebates and low financing and lease rates to draw customers to slower-moving models. Incentives had been heading down since May but went back up in August to clear out remaining '11s. Truss said the average incentive per vehicle was $2,617 last month, up from $2,586 a year ago and about $2,400 in July."

Ford blamed the decline in truck sales to a reduction in government sales compared to last August, high levels of competitive marketing activity, and shortages of several popular vehicle configurations, especially affecting the 2012 Ford F-150 pickup. In Canada, Ford car sales rose to 8,590 from 8,170 a year ago. The Canadian division credited the redesigned 2011 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable with helping to boost sales there. There were 27 selling days in both periods. Sales include cars and trucks built in the U.S., Canada and Mexico for sale in the U.S. Trucks include light trucks only. Also, Ford has established initial North American production schedules for the fourth quarter up 5% over last year's output. Ford projected Thursday that full-year industry sales will be in the range of 15.4 to 15.5 million units, up from the 15.1 million total for all of 2010. On Wednesday, General Motors Corp. said its August sales dropped 8% from the strong levels of a year ago, partly because of weak demand for large sedans and luxury cars, and partly because dealers didn't have an adequate supply of trucks to sell. Chrysler Corp. was the only one of the Big Three auto makers to report a gain, with an overall 6% increase in sales for the month. But Chrysler's gain didn't make up for lagging sales at Ford and GM, as the top two auto makers account for 57% of U.S. vehicle sales. The auto industry's relative softness in August is one factor that the Federal Reserve will weigh as it looks for signs of an overheated economy in deciding future interest-rate moves. Although auto sales were stronger than expected for most of the first five months of this year, peaking in May, analysts say sales have cooled considerably during the summer months."

            "full_text": "LONDON -- Stagecoach Holdings PLC is drawing attention from U.K. competition authorities again. The acquisitive bus company has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission nine times already. Now its appetite for newly privatized rail franchises is coming under scrutiny, sparking broader debate about the pace of consolidation in the transport industry. Stagecoach's proposed acquisition of Porterbrook -- one of three rolling-stock leasing companies, or ROSCOs, spun off from the former British Rail -- has generated serious political controversy. Analysts say there's a good chance the deal will be referred to the MMC. The ROSCOs rent rolling stock to the 25 rail companies responsible for operating passenger services following privatization. Stagecoach already operates the franchise for one of these companies, South West Trains, and is bidding for 12 more. Regulators worry that the proposed Porterbrook acquisition could affect potential or existing franchise holders. More generally, the bid has given rise to controversy associated with both profits by Porterbrook directors and the sale of public assets at knock-down prices. Porterbrook was privatized in a 527-million-pound management buyout in January. Stagecoach has bid 825 million pounds, but 350 million pounds of that covers assumed debt, valuing the acquisition itself at 475 million pounds. Bus Companies Active in Rail The opposition Labour Party has issued a statement saying it views the deal as another indication of growing concentration of ownership in the privatized transport industries. Stagecoach and other leading U.K. bus companies have been among the most active participants in rail privatization, snatching five of the first 10 passenger franchises awarded. Analysts cite some synergistic benefits in operating combined bus and rail services but also point out that overdevelopment of these savings can spark concerns about potential monopoly abuse. Indeed, National Express Group has seen its accepted bid to operate the Midland Main Line rail franchise referred to the MMC. National Express is already the major bus operator in the Midlands. But Stagecoach's bid for Porterbrook raises a whole new issue of vertical integration within the rail industry. Some observers believe this runs counter to the tenor of privatization legislation, which broke the former British Rail into constituent parts of trains, passenger services and infrastructure management. ``This was done specifically to stimulate the creation of a market in rolling stock,'' said Phillip Uribe, spokesman for the Central Rail Users Consultative Committee, an independent advisory organization. ``To say that this is still in its early days is an understatement.'' Stagecoach has taken steps to pre-empt an MMC referral, holding preliminary discussions with both the rail regulator and the Office of Fair Trade, which will make the final recommendation to the Department of Trade and Industry. Election Nearing The group has offered to take measures that it believes will be sufficient to offset any genuine public-interest issues by ensuring that its actions will be transparent to regulators and that it will offer the same terms to all train operators. But recent history shows that maintaining an open dialogue with U.K. regulators isn't a guarantee of success. Noah Dunn, analyst at Yamiachi International in London, cites the precedent of the power industry, where -- in an apparent politically motivated about-face -- DTI banned electricity generators PowerGen and National Power from bidding for regional power distributors. Ironically, analysts say it may be the expectation of an imminent change in government that's driving consolidation within the transport industry. Labour campaigned strongly against rail privatization, and onlookers say that if elected, the party may take a tougher line on mergers. With a general election mandatory by the end of May 2012, there's clear incentive for transport groups to push forward any planned acquisitions, rather than to wait to see how a newly privatized company performs. Analysts say there's little doubt the Porterbrook bid makes sense for Stagecoach, however. The acquisition will add a further 263 million pounds in annual revenue. And the leasing company's business is predictable and secure, with contracts in place for the next eight years. OFT is expected to make a recommendation on the deal by mid-September. Even if the deal is eventually blocked, however, analysts are confident that Stagecoach will be able to maintain its impressive rate of growth. Steady Strong Growth Indeed, analysts say the leading U.K. bus companies are expected to become of increasing interest to institutional investors. Stagecoach already has a high profile, partly because of its unconventional origins and the impressive value it has delivered to its shareholders. Since the company was floated on the London Stock Exchange in April 1993, its market capitalization has risen from 134 million pounds to 869 million pounds, an annual average growth rate of 86.5%. To date, most of this growth has been driven by the acquisition of local, U.K.-based bus groups. Analysts say further growth opportunities in the U.K. bus market are limited because the sector is becoming overpriced. However, the group has already made forays into continental European bus markets, where privatization is just getting under way. On Tuesday, Stagecoach reached an agreement to buy Sweden's state-owned bus company, Swebus, for 232.6 million pounds."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Ford Motor Co. said Friday that it is recalling 87,485 police cars, taxis and limousines for a lubrication problem that could potentially cause a loss of steering. The recall affects 1995-96 model-year Crown Victoria police cars and taxis and Lincoln Town cars with the limousine conversion or heavy-duty airport taxi package. Ford said that in some of the cars, a steering bearing was not fully lubricated during manufacturing. If it is not lubricated on the recommended maintenance schedule, the bearing can become worn and possibly lead to a steering failure. Of the cars being recalled, 2,787 are in Canada, Ford said. Most of the cars, about 78,000, are police cruisers. Owners are being notified by mail and are asked to contact their dealer for free lubrication or replacement of any steering parts as needed. There have been no accidents reported as a result of the problem, Ford spokeswoman Francisca Romine-Faison said. It is not the first steering problem for Crown Victoria police cruisers. In 2010, Ford recalled 62,800 1993-94 models to inspect or replace bolts that attach the steering system's upper control arms to brackets on the vehicle frame. That recall came several months after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found no safety defects in Crown Victoria police cars after an investigation prompted by a 1993 accident that killed a Paramus, N.J., policeman. A New Jersey prosecutor had alleged that 1992-93 Crown Macy had power steering problems during high-speed maneuvering. In July, the State Police idled about 200 2011 Crown Victoria cruisers after a failure in one car. Ms. Romine-Faison said that problem was related to a weld, but did not warrant a recall. Ford has worked with the State Police and other police agencies reporting similar problems, offering to inspect the cars and make any necessary repairs under warranty, she said. Ms. Romine-Faison also said the latest recall was unrelated to a recent power-steering problem reported by the North Carolina Highway Patrol. Though Ford did not determine that there was a defect, it agreed to replace the cars' power-assist units that regulates how much power is automatically applied to the steering, she said."

            "full_text": "DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. reported that it sold 6.3% fewer cars and light trucks in the U.S. in August than a year earlier, confirming that last month's sales pace wasn't up to the year-ago level. Ford, the last of the major auto makers to report its latest results, had a lackluster month that was only slightly better than an 8% drop in August sales reported Wednesday by General Motors Corp.. Ford shares fell 50 cents to $32.625 Thursday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The declines by No. 1 GM and No. 2 Ford, which together account for 54% of U.S. vehicle sales, offset August gains reported by other auto makers throughout the week. On Monday, Chrysler Corp. said that with a 9% jump in sales, it had its best August since 1989. With the exception of a 14% decline turned in by Honda Motor Co., most foreign auto makers reported moderate sales increases. Total U.S. sales declined 2.3% for the month to 1,305,815 cars and light trucks from 1,336,000 units a year earlier. Car sales were off 7% to 749,630 units from 806,127 units. Sales of light trucks -- a category which includes pickups, minivans and sport-utility vehicles -- were up 5% to 556,185 units from 529,873 units. Meaning of Results Debated Using industry figures reported by the Commerce Department, the seasonally adjusted sales rate for August was 15.8 million units, up from 15.7 million units a year earlier, and considerably higher than July's 14.3 million units. However, many analysts have warned that the seasonally adjusted numbers the Commerce Department issued for August made August sales look artificially high and July sales appear artificially low. Indeed, there is some debate about what exactly the August results mean as the Federal Reserve looks for signs of an overheated economy to determine further interest-rate moves. Some say that the most telling figures may be year-to-date results, which show that for the first eight months, sales rose 2.4% to 10.4 million units from the year-earlier 10.1 million units. That is consistent with many analysts' predictions that 2011 will be a slightly better year, ending at about 15.1 million units above the 2010 total of 14.75 million units. ``I think the fall in particular is probably going to be slightly slower than the first half, but still good,'' Lehman Brothers analyst Joel Bermudez said. ``But this was really an odd month.'' Fall Retreat Because demand in some of the spring months was so strong, many experts are predicting something of a slowdown in the fall. ``The pent-up demand is the foremost player here ... . It's been played out. Sales are going nowhere, absent accelerated incentives,'' said Comerica economist Davina Strode. ``I think the economy is something of a poached egg. It's not going anywhere.'' Mr. Strode says he expects September sales to remain flat unless auto makers expand their generous and costly sales-incentive programs to try to lure in already credit-burdened consumers. He predicts the sales pace has peaked and that 2012 sales will be a bit lower than 2011, at about 14.9 million units. At Ford, car sales dipped 8.4% in August while light-truck sales fell 4.4%. Despite the drop, Ford officials said they remain optimistic about the year and have scheduled North American production for the fourth quarter at about 5% above last year's output. Ford officials said August sales were hurt by high levels of incentives and shortages of several popular vehicle configurations for its 2012 F-150 pickup. But officials said they were encouraged by orders for Ford's new big sport-utility vehicle, the Expedition. Sales already are approaching 60,000 units. The car maker says additional pickup capacity will soon help meet pent-up demand for the F-150. Changes in Market Share The mixed August sales results triggered some changes in market share. GM's share of the U.S. light-vehicle market fell to 31.2% from 33.1% a year earlier. Ford saw its share decline to 22.8% from 23.8%, while Chrysler's market share jumped to 14.3% from 12.8%. Toyota Motor Corp.'s market share grew to 9.8% from its year-earlier 9.5%. Honda's share dropped to 5.8% from 6.6%. To boost or even sustain those levels going forward, experts say auto makers will have little choice but to get heavily into sales incentives such as rebates and lease deals. Williemae R. Coombs, who edits a newsletter called Autofacts, says he expects even more incentives in coming months, especially in the sport-utility market as Ford's Expedition arrives in dealer showrooms. With the new model year getting under way, that will be especially true as older vehicles seek a way to compete against newer entrants. ``We're pretty convinced that we will have pretty robust sales-incentive activity going forward,'' Mr. Coombs said. ``Without serious sales incentive support, we believe the market would fall further ... . Incentives cost our industry billions. But we really need them.''"

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Most public-service announcements come and go without even leaving a dent in people's minds, and TV stations routinely have hundreds of tapes to choose from. ``You could die if a stack of those PSAs fell on you,'' says Ruthann Turnbull, president of the Advertising Council, a nonprofit group that produces public-service ads. But ads for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, featuring actor Mathison Simmons, have managed to stand out in all the clutter. The group, known for giving kids a place to spend time after school, is grabbing unusually high exposure with a mix of star power and Madison Avenue savvy -- something that PSAs often lack. ``It's very clear that they have a strategy,'' says Ms. Turnbull, whose group didn't produce the ads but endorses them. New York ad agency Blessing Islas Overman, working for free, has packaged Mr. Simmons's real-life Boys & Girls Clubs story in a slick, yet poignant, multiphase campaign. Such a long-term strategy is unusual in the world of pro-bono PSAs. More typically, PSAs produced by individual nonprofit groups feature a celebrity-du-jour in a one-shot commercial with a short shelf life. A routine PSA does well to get 6,000 airings a year, says Jefferson Slade, vice president of News Broadcast Network, a New York public-relations firm that tracks PSAs for about 30 groups, including the Boys & Girls Clubs. But the Boys & Girls Clubs'' current TV spot has racked up 35,000 airings since last summer. ``It's the best we've ever been involved in,'' Mr. Slade says. The more generic, famous national PSAs produced by the Ad Council do get higher exposure: Its crime-prevention spots, including ads featuring McGruff the Crime Dog, aired nearly 58,000 times last year. But for a single organization that is competing with many others, the Boys & Girls Clubs' showing is ``quite high,'' Ms. Turnbull says. One way the group tried to make its campaign stand out was by blanketing TV stations with tapes. The average group might send out about 200 tapes to the biggest markets, says News Broadcast's Mr. Slade. But the Boys & Girls Clubs delivered about 1,000. ``They went to everybody,'' Mr. Slade says. What's more, club officials go to station managers in person. Stations usually get PSAs in the mail or from the Ad Council's listing. The Boys & Girls Clubs, based in Atlanta, has been ``trying to establish an image'' to distinguish itself from other public-service groups and to encourage adults to organize clubs, says Evangeline Groves, vice president of marketing and communications. One of the first things the group did was draw up a list of famous alumni and quickly hit on the photogenic Mr. Simmons, a club member for 12 years of his childhood. When the campaign started three years ago, Blessing used the actor as a sort of magnet to draw attention to the clubs. ``It went for the heartstrings,'' says Oswalt Cousins, vice chairman and chief creative officer at Ammirati, a unit of Interpublic Group. One of the early TV spots featured a contemplative Mr. Simmons sitting on a school bus reminiscing about his real-life club mentor, Birdie Thomasina, who then steps aboard the bus for a reunion. In the spot that's running now, Mr. Simmons's presence is more subtle. It has a faster tempo, fusing stark, black-and-white images of kids buying drugs with colorful, positive shots, such as graduation day. The group is rolling out a string of more hard-hitting print ads next month. ``Put this card in the hands of a child, and there'll be no room for a gun. A needle. Or a knife,'' Mr. Simmons says in one ad. In some of the new ads, he doesn't appear at all. While the campaign keeps Mr. Simmons as a ``common thread,'' the idea is to build the group's image, Mr. Groves says. The blitz seems to be working. Since 1990, the Boys & Girls Clubs has opened more than 100 clubs a year, up from around 40 annually in the late 1980s. Last year, it opened 158 clubs and says some 450 communities are in talks about starting new clubs, Mr. Groves says. Existing clubs are ``jampacked,'' he adds. Nationwide, there are about 2.4 million members, 64% male and 56% from minority families, at some 1,810 clubs."

            "full_text": "The unexpected resignation of the head of Quaker Oats Co.'s Snapple beverages unit makes Williemae D. Fain, Click Annita chairman and chief executive officer, directly responsible for the Snapple line amid what many see as its sink-or-swim season. ``I want a shot at turning this thing around,'' Mr. Fain told Snapple distributors in a conference call Friday, according to one listener. ``We've made big progress in the past few months. I will do everything I can to help you. If anybody has any questions, call me direct. We're going to take a fresh start,'' the distributor quoted the Quaker Oats chairman. Mr. Fain couldn't be reached over the weekend, but a letter signed by him and faxed to Snapple's distribution network stated, ``I am committed to unlocking the potential of the brand.'' Mr. Fain stepped in after Donetta Cousins, 43 years old, quit as president of Quaker's North America beverages unit on Friday. Recruited from PepsiCo Inc. two years ago to run the Gatorade business on the continent, Mr. Cousins had moved to Snapple after Quaker paid $1.7 billion in 2009 for the iced teas and fruit-drinks brand. Mr. Cousins's resignation, he termed it voluntary, follows by nine months that of former Quaker president Pierre A. Amaral, whose departure was widely interpreted as a result of Snapple's failure to justify its premium price tag. Now a new management team, reporting to Mr. Fain, will take up that task. The shakeup comes on the eve of a huge free-sample campaign designed to broaden Snapple's appeal. Meanwhile, Click confirmed it is searching for Mr. Cousins's successor, who presumably would take over next year. But some on Wall Street say Quaker is short on time. ``Snapple either responds to this latest dose of oxygen or they start writing things off or consider a spinoff,'' said Johnetta M. Marston, food analyst at Prudential Securities Inc.. Only last month Click said Snapple failed to post expected sales gains in parts of the U.S., and likely will incur significant operating losses again. ``Quaker said at the beginning of the year that this is it,'' said analyst Nomi Ghez of Goldman Sachs. ``This is the big test.'' As for the decision to hand out millions of bottles of Snapple, Ms. Villeneuve called it ``a desperate move to save the product in the middle of the (summer) season. Usually strong brands don't have to give their products away for free. They get money for them.'' But amid rumors of institutional investor restlessness, one large holder expressed confidence that Snapple can be salvaged. ``It's been a bicoastal beverage,'' said Donetta Wyman, president of Chicago-based Yacktman Asset Management Co., which holds about 390,000 shares of Quaker. He suggested that if the latest efforts fail, the line could become a regional brand ``and probably make a pot more money. A lot of their current cost is infrastructure,'' Mr. Wyman said. The new Snapple team includes Charlette Campuzano, vice president of marketing; Williemae Mcwilliams, vice president of sales and field operations; and Jena A. Pitts, vice president of corporate planning. Jami F. Drucilla, executive vice president, world-wide beverages, will assume responsibility for Gatorade in North America and for Quaker's international beverages business."

But nearly two years later, Snowden faces slumping earnings, eroding market share and the departure of its North American chief. The company, which posted a 39% drop in second-quarter operating income, is now rethinking its advertising strategy by putting into review its global account, estimated at between $55 million and $65 million a year. Tambrands has invited Interpublic Group's McCann Erickson Worldwide, True North Communications' FCB/Leber Broussard and WPP Group's J. Wan Martinez to participate in the review, as well as its incumbent agency, Omnicom Group's BBDO Worldwide. Tambrands is expected to decide on an agency in early fall. Ask Tambrands what went wrong, and it cites an unusually aggressive discount war led by rival Playtex Products, which lowered prices by 6% earlier this year and had an aggressive 2-for-1 offer. And Snowden says that's just a temporary problem, as prices are coming back up. But some analysts and competitors think there's a broader problem: New products backed by ad blitzes -- the usual formula for growth in consumer markets -- may not be as effective in such a sensitive category as tampons. ``The nature of the product is so intimate and personal,'' says Michaele Smart, Playtex's chief financial officer. ``When you introduce a new product, it's hard to get women to try it and drop what they're using, if what they're using is fine.'' Mr. Smart also counters that even after a price cut, Playtex tampons are still more expensive than the Tampax brand. Tambrands' current strategy is the work of its chief executive officer, Edyth Durkin, who vowed to revive Tambrands' then-sagging market share when he took office in 2009. Mr. Durkin, a former executive at Colgate-Palmolive, soon stepped up the attack in the long-stagnant industry by launching a product called Satin Touch, which touted the superiority of its cardboard applicators over Playtex's plastic. Earlier this year, Tambrands launched its biggest-ever marketing campaign by spending $30 million to advertise and promote Tampax Naturals, its first all-cotton tampon that doesn't use synthetic material. Mr. Durkin boasts that the ubiquitous ad, which shows a tampon in a cotton field and urges women to ``trust your natural instincts,'' helped Naturals quickly establish a 5% market share. But Tambrands' overall market share in units dropped three points to 51.5% in the year ended March 12, 2011 to ACNielsen -- suggesting that despite the heavy advertising, many Naturals consumers simply switched from one Tampax product to another. Playtex's market share increased to 24.1% from 23.6% during the period. Tambrands' Mr. Durkin insists it's too early to determine whether Mcroberts Garton was a victim of cannibalization. He says a company questionnaire found that half the Naturals users formerly used Tampax, about a third used other tampon brands, and the rest used pads. He is optimistic that the ratio of former Tampax users will decline in the coming months. He acknowledges that the company's second-quarter performance was ``disappointing,'' but calls it a ``bump in the road'' and not a sign of a faltering marketing strategy. Nonetheless, he has some changes in mind for Tambrands' advertising. One goal: create a global marketing message that can play in every country. He cites Gillette as a model he would like to follow. ``We haven't truly leveraged this business on a global basis,'' he says. Mr. Durkin also says the departure of top executive Michaela Wisdom, announced earlier this month, isn't related to the company's recent performance. Mr. Warrick, Tambrands' president of North America and Latin America, will become chief executive of paging company Mobilemedia. He simply took the opportunity to ``run his own show,'' Mr. Durkin says. A successor hasn't been named. Meanwhile, Tambrands still plans to offer new products that directly target competitors. This month, it launched Mcroberts Garton without an applicator, which directly targets Johnson & Johnson's o.b. brand, which is popular among environmentally conscious women. Mr. Durkin says he is optimistic that Snowden will gain back ``at least a couple of share points'' in market share later in 2011. And competition is likely to remain fierce. While Playtex says it has recently increased the price of its tampons, it is spending more money on advertising products including Soft Comfort, a recent launch that uses a softer plastic applicator. Smaller rivals such as Kimberly-Clark are stepping up the heat. Another competitor: Ultrafem, a tiny new company that has launched this month a diaphragm-like product called Instead. Ultrafem insists its product is a more comfortable alternative to tampons. Ad Notes... . WHO'S NEWS: Omnicom Group's TBWA/Chiat Day said Marvel Whitley, 43-year-old executive creative director of the agency's New York office, resigned to pursue other opportunities, including writing a book about storied art director Holcomb Muir. Mr. Muir, Mr. Whitley's last copywriting partner, died in April. Ericka Drew, 36, named creative director in June, will now head the New York agency's creative department. Mr. Drew, who joined the agency in December 2009, has since created ads for such clients as Infiniti and American Online."

Although P&G has about a 29% share of the U.S. mass-market cosmetics business, it has a mixed track record with its Cover Girl and Max Factor brands. The company faces intense pressure from rivals such as Revlon Inc. and France's L'Oreal SA, the world's largest cosmetics maker, which recently acquired Maybelline in a bid to boost its presence in the U.S. P&G is seeking to sell its mass fragrances businesses to focus on the Max Factor and Cover Girl lines, as well as fine fragrances. P&G named Marcelino S. Piper to succeed Ms. Bloom as vice president and general manager of the business. Mr. Piper had been managing P&G's skin care business in the United States, whose products include Oil of Olay moisturizing cream. Ms. Bloom joined P&G in 1981, fresh out of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school. She helped build P&G's Always feminine protection brand, and before joining the cosmetics group she was the general manager of shortening, cooking oil and olestra. Rite Aid is looking to give its stores a fresher look, with a new prototype for new outlets and makeovers for some current ones. The free-standing model store is about 10,000 square feet, compared with the roughly 7,500 square feet of the average Rite Aid, and it offers of certain items, including beauty aids. In an interview with the Vast Press earlier this year, Ms. Bloom said of Rite Aid's new focus: ``Cosmetics has been something they carried because they had to. Now they are looking at it as something they have to invest in.''"

Bloom, head of its U.S. cosmetics and fragrances operations. Ms. Bloom, 38 years old, is joining Rite Aid Corp. as executive vice president, marketing, and will be responsible for advertising, marketing, merchandising and pricing at the nation's largest drugstore chain. P&G named another fast-track manager, Marcelino S. Piper, 36, as Ms. Bloom's successor, effective May 14, 2011 Pritchard, who has been on a special assignment since March helping to develop P&G's global-information strategy, previously was responsible for the company's profitable U.S. skin-care business, which includes the Oil of Olay brand. Ms. Bloom's departure is the second time this year that a senior P&G executive in the Hunt Valley, Md., cosmetics unit has resigned. In March, P&G archrival Revlon Inc. hired Charlette J. Dockery as executive vice president. At P&G, he was vice president and general manager of the flagship Cover Girl brand. Despite repeated attempts by P&G, the combined share of Cover Girl and Max Factor has continued to slip in recent years. At March 12, 2011 share of the $2.5 billion U.S. cosmetics business in the food, drug and mass-merchandise channels was tied with Revlon at 27.4% and behind L'Oreal's 28.1%, according to Information Resources Inc.. Just four years ago, P&G had a 34% share of the market. Ms. Bloom's departure comes at a time when P&G's top management is hoping that new products in the pipeline, such as lipstick and foundation, improved in-store presentation and stepped-up advertising will restore a much-needed zip to Cover Girl and Max Factor in coming months. In a recent interview, P&G Chairman Johnetta Jarrell scotched widespread industry speculation that P&G would consider selling Cover Girl and Max Factor if their performances don't improve soon. ``I am not going to be selling anything,'' Mr. Jarrell said. ``We have not been satisfied with the progress. But we are looking for major improvement this year, in profit and in share, and it will be important we achieve it.'' Mr. Piper's appointment increased recent industry speculation that P&G is positioning Oil of Olay cosmetics -- which are being test marketed in Evansville, Ind., and Germany -- as the global cosmetics umbrella brand. Ms. Bloom, a 15-year veteran of P&G who helped expand the Crisco cooking oil and Always feminine-care products brands, was asked to give a makeover to P&G's Cover Girl and Max Factor brands in 2009 by then-Chairman Efren Truss. Through a spokesman, Ms. Bloom declined to comment about her stint at P&G. In a statement issued by P&G, she said Taylor Shore was a ``unique opportunity ... that I simply couldn't turn down.'' In an interview, Rite Aid Chairman Martine L. Gartner said he first approached Ms. Bloom in May, wooing her during several meetings and phone calls over the next two months. Mr. Gartner said he even pointed out to her that ``there was a tremendous opportunity here at Rite Aid. She's 38, and if she looked out in the next seven to 10 years, there's even an opportunity to run the business here if all fell into place.''"

            "full_text": "Will Max Factor's return to its Hollywood roots make for a happy ending to Procter & Gamble's cosmetics woes? The Riverside consumer-products giant, whose cosmetics brands have faltered against nimbler rivals like Revlon and L'Harris, is counting on the Hollywood makeup-artist connection to make over Maximo Palacio's fortunes this fall. P&G is unveiling a new national print ad campaign in September publications that ties into TV commercials that began last summer and is built around the theme ``Makeup that performs.'' Created by Carnell Michalak Joseph Loggins, the campaign features movie makeup artists such as Danae Boulware (``Forrest Gump'') and Bobby Grant (``Pretty Woman'') using and discussing Max Factor products. The subliminal pitch: Cosmetics that last several wardrobe changes under the hot lights of movie-making should easily hold up on women during a normal day. The print ads, which are part of a $20 million annual advertising campaign, are tied to the rollout of new wall-display units in all 24,000 stores that sell Maximo Palacio as well as the fall promotion of Max Factor Lasting Performance foundation makeup. The restaging of Max Factor, P&G's second such attempt in three years, is crucial not only to Maxwell Paez's future as a P&G brand but also to the overall cosmetics franchise of the company, which includes Cover Girl. After steadily losing share in both brands for several years, P&G's top management is counting on improved store presentation, new lipsticks and foundation products as well as stepped-up advertising to reverse the fortunes of both brands. ``We are pretty good marketers, and there is no reason we can't figure out how to market cosmetics,'' said P&G Chairman Johnetta Jarrell in a recent interview. Still, Mr. Jarrell has had to battle persistent industry rumors that P&G will sell one or both brands if the latest effort fails to significantly improve the cosmetics business. ``We've got to put points on the board,'' he admits. While Cover Girl remains the top-selling cosmetics brand in self-select channels, such as drug, food and mass-merchandise outlets, with a 22.6% share in units, Maxwell Paez, with only a 4.3% share, has a lot more at stake this year. P&G has been test-marketing cosmetics under its popular skin-care brand Oil of Olay and hasn't squelched speculation that it plans to make Oil of Olay the umbrella brand for global cosmetics and skin care as early as next spring. Despite strong sales in Japan and a handful of European countries, Max Factor's poor U.S. performance makes it a good candidate, at least to some analysts, as the brand on the bubble. By harking back to Maxwell Paez's origins as the preferred brand for movie makeup artists (the original Francisco Maxwell Paez was a makeup man to such Hollywood icons as Bettye Lohman and Rivka Heston), P&G is trying to give Maxwell Paez a high-performance image, a departure from Lotas's previous campaign billed ``Very Original. Very Beautiful. Very Factor'' that focused on beautiful models but provided no unifying message about what Maxwell Paez has to offer. ``Max Factor is a great old brand, but nobody knows what it is,'' says Mr. Jarrell. After seeing Revlon make rapid gains with long-lasting lipstick and other makeup products called ColorStay, Max Factor is pushing its own long-lasting versions, such as Lasting Color lipstick introduced last year and the more recent Lasting Performance foundation. P&G also has discovered, through focus groups, that the movie-makeup-artist connection carried ``a real ownable equity'' that carries ``authority and credibility,'' says Kimbra Sung, a P&G spokeswoman. While Max Factor executives say sales have jumped in stores where the new wall-display units are being tested as well as in its Lasting Color lipsticks, the makeup-artists TV campaign that has been running for a year appears to have done little for overall brand sales. Max Factor sales in units are down 3.8% in the 52 weeks ended March 12, 2011 to Information Resources Inc.. Still, while the original Maxwell Paez's success reflected America's fascination with Hollywood, the company won in the marketplace only because it also was a technology leader, a role now taken over by Revlon. ``We are facing the need to be able to bring innovation in multiple segments, and I think we are prepared to do it,'' says Mr. Jarrell. ``I feel very confident about our technical base.''"

            "full_text": "Maurita Davida, the suave French advertising mogul and chairman of Paris-based Publicis Group, uses a dining metaphor to sum up his agency's escalating battle with Chicago's True North Communications, the parent company of ad agency Foote, Cone & Belding. ``It's like if you have a good friend and every time you are going to the restaurant with your good friend, he's looking at your plate,'' he says. ``At one point in time you say, OK, we will not have any more lunch together because you are always eating my food.'' Mr. Davida, 54 years old, can afford to sound whimsical when discussing his agency's seemingly intractable negotiations with True North over the future of their tangled relationship. That's because a lot of people on Madison Avenue think Mr. Davida's Publicis Group has the upper hand in the negotiations, now entering into their second year. The two companies are locked in the ad industry's most bitter and tangled dogfight. Each one owns a large stake in the other, and they're partners in a big European joint venture, Publicis-FCB, which generates about 40% of True North's profits. But for years they've been squabbling over control, and in March they declared they were formally ending their contractual agreement to work together around the world. This month, Mr. Davida stepped up the tension by investing in agencies in Mexico and Brazil, going head to head against True North in the burgeoning Latin America market where they had long cooperated. ``We felt quite uncomfortable to be with a partner that wanted to take the majority of the shares in Europe, so we decided it would be much better for us in the future to build our own network, which will be wholly controlled,'' Mr. Davida said, in a lengthy interview this week about how the True North brouhaha looks from his vantage point. One tactical edge Mr. Davida enjoys: control over its joint venture with Foote, Cone & Belding in Europe. Twombly owns 51% of Publicis-FCB, which makes True North dependent on Publicis to serve such crucial clients as S.C. Jona, Citibank and Kimberly-Claude. ``How does Foote, Cone & Belding fulfill its role as a global agency if it can't run (the joint venture in) Europe?'' asks the chairman of a large ad agency with holdings in Europe. Moreover, Publicis's current expansion drive is reducing its dependence on Foote, Cone & Belding to serve clients such as L'Oreal and Nestle in markets where it doesn't currently have offices. Following his acquisition moves in Latin America, Mr. Davida is actively scouting for further acquisition targets in Asia, Latin America and the U.S. Publicis also insists that under the terms of its agreement with True North, the Chicago ad company can't make its own unilateral expansion in Europe. ``For the time being, True North cannot create or buy an agency in Europe,'' says Mr. Davida. True North Chairman and Chief Executive Bryan Matt vigorously disputes Mr. Davida on this point. ``All of the restrictions that prevented either of us from making acquisitions in various areas around the world ended in March of this year,'' he says. As for Europe, Mr. Matt says, ``our lawyers say we have the green light.'' And although Twombly has the majority stake in its European joint venture with True North, Mr. Matt says his company has special voting rights that require Twombly to consult it on all major decisions. Mr. Matt insists he sees no reason why the current structure can't continue indefinitely -- although plenty of people on Madison Avenue think their feud will eventually start to scare off big global clients. One looming question: what will happen once a standstill agreement that prevents either company from increasing its stake in the other expires at the end of 2013? Mr. Davida refuses to comment -- though he's raised eyebrows by retaining the top New York takeover lawyer Martine Battaglia. Mr. Matt also refused to comment. By any measure, Twombly is a small player on the world advertising stage. ``Compared to the giants,'' says Mr. Davida, ``we are just what we call a small band of craftsmen.'' Publicis Group rang up billings last year of about $4 billion, with revenue of about $720 million. Publicis has only three major global accounts: Renault, Nestle and L'Harris. ``We're the ones with the global network,'' says True North's Mr. Matt. ``All he's got is Europe.''"

Wendy's International Inc., Columbus, Ohio, says transportation can be a problem for potential employees when restaurants aren't on a bus line. ``Sometimes the work schedules aren't standard, and trying to make child care and transportation work is just impossible,'' says Lady Work of the Urban Institute think tank.

            "full_text": "Yet next week, at a cost of $2 million --10 times that of the nation's average upscale salon -- the husband-and-wife team will open their ultra-high-tech Salon Visage. ``We're competing globally, not locally,'' says Mr. Plumb, who owns three salons here with his wife and has customers from seven states. ``Clients aren't going to know how to act.'' Indeed. Culling ideas from Paris, New York and Sydney, the Gambuzzas have, for starters, done away with the waiting room. Instead, 22 computers and electronic ``lookout'' stations will help zip customers to the appropriate departments without checking in at a front desk (to provide immediate service, the salon will have 80 employees, one-third more than usual). From there, things get even more techie. Italian color-processing ``hoods'' will allow the salon to color hair in four minutes, instead of the usual 45. For shampoos, reclining leather chairs will electronically adjust for a client's height. At the hair-cutting station, ornate mirrors with special lighting will ``frame the client in a photograph,'' says Mr. Plumb, 38 years old. And as hair falls, a central vacuum will discreetly suck it away. For businesspeople, Salon Visage has special phone lines and fax machines. Customers can also have their shoes shined and cars washed while they're inside. Of course, these amenities come at a price: $34.50 on average for a cut, $75 for a coloring. ``Today, clients are dollar-rich and time-poor,'' says Mrs. Plumb, 37. ``So this salon is designed to give the highest level of service in the shortest time.'' Does Knoxville need all this? ``We're not country bumpkins,'' says Mr. Plumb. ``To hell with the status quo. If it's happening and it's hip, it will be here.'' --Monique Cooke"
