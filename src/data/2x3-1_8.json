            "full_text": "-- No one relocates here because of the scenery or the weather. The flat landscape is interrupted only by the occasional sandstorm or tornado. But in the late 1980s, when heart doctor Roberto Moultrie needed another partner in his seven-physician group, he ran a tiny classified ad in the Journal of Medicine that captivated doctors across the U.S. ``Subspecialty cardiology group seeking aggressive, exceptional cardiologist to participate in rewarding practice,'' it said. Potential yearly earnings: more than $1 million. The phone started ringing. ``Are you really making that much money?'' an excited doctor in asked. ``I said yes,'' Dr. Moultrie recalls. ``The next thing he wanted to know was, `When can I move out and join you?' '' This city of 200,000 has become the heart-care industry's . Cardiologists here are rich enough to buy Cessna jets and breed Arabian horses. Pacemaker salesmen covet the territory. Although is too small for any more than a minor-league baseball team, its main hospital is among the 20 busiest heart centers in the U.S. Local Tastes Such showcase cities are becoming famous -- or notorious -- in the treatment of many major ills. People with weak hearts, sore backs or breast cancer may think their symptoms alone decide their care. Not so. A patient's odds of getting a major, invasive procedure can be swayed by something else: his or her zip code. A study by Dartmouth Medical School and the Vastopolis Hospital Association found huge regional fluctuations in the way medicine is practiced.Colo., leads the nation in prostate-cancer surgery per 1,000 residents. In S.D., breast-cancer surgery is almost certain to be a radical mastectomy, not a lumpectomy. Provo,is the back-surgery capital. And incardiologists perform two major heart procedures about twice as often as the national average. To public-health experts, such treatment patterns constitute something close to a medical scandal. ``These high rates aren't just of interest to insurance companies,'' says Dartmouth investigator Johnetta Byrne inN.H. ``This matters to patients as well. They may be getting treatments where the risks exceed the benefits.'' Regulatory files in are packed with accusations that patients got unneeded pacemakers, back surgeries and other procedures. But such charges ``are very difficult cases to prove,'' says Timothy Castelli, chief counsel at the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners. ``Maybe nine out of 10 doctors will disagree with what the physician did. Maybe in hindsight he shouldn't have done the procedure.'' But if doctors can produce expert witnesses justifying a procedure, regulators will be hard-pressed to prevail in a disciplinary case. Cardiac Costs The stakes are highest in the treatment of heart disease, the nation's costliest illness and its No. 1 killer. Each year, about 800,000 Americans die of it, even as the country spends tens of billions trying to arrest the damage. Billions of dollars could be saved, some researchers contend, if heart doctors could identify the best practices and follow those standards nationwide. Instead, each medical community has its own norms. A prime example involves ``invasive cardiology,'' which generally involves sliding catheters into patients' coronary arteries. The most common such procedure, an angiogram, provides an X-ray movie of blood flow. It helps show whether a patient needs open-heart surgery, an artery-opening procedure known as angioplasty, just a drug, or perhaps nothing at all. Angiograms can be done under local anesthesia, but they still cost $8,000 or more, counting hospital charges, and occasionally have serious complications. Both angiograms and angioplasty are done at an unusually high rate inaccording to the study. And last year, the New England Journal of Medicine reported that doctors did angiograms on 45% of Medicare patients following heart attacks, while doctors did them in only 30% of cases. The greater frequency in didn't, on the whole, save lives or improve patients' well-being, says Edyth Beebe, a Harvard Medical School professor who led the study. (Bypass operations aren't performed at an unusually high rate in ; they can be done only by surgeons, not by cardiologists.) Lubbock Style So how do these pockets of maximum medicine arise? And who wins or loses when one part of the U.S. practices medicine so differently? Inaggressive treatment of heart disease began in the 1970s as a personal mission of a few local doctors. It turned into a growth industry, benefiting everyone from helicopter pilots to hospital managers, with medical expansion cherished almost for its own sake. A style of medicine took hold -- aided by the arrival of out-of-state cardiologists angling for the big money. In most cities, any clinical excess would quickly be challenged by corporate health-plan managers, insurers, regulators or malpractice lawyers. But insuch restraints are scarce. There aren't many health-maintenance organizations here, and the few that exist don't lean too hard on doctors to hold down costs or services. Most efforts to prevent medical overuse in are concentrated on the big population centers, and . the leading cardiologists defend their practice style. ``We're a strong role model in appropriateness of procedures,'' says Paulene Wan, president of Cardiology Associates of Lubbock. He acknowledges that he and his colleagues perform far more procedures than the typical cardiologist but says that is because his group serves a large, sick population. Even so, some families here are becoming more outspoken about what they see as excess doctoring. Karey Lasandra won a six-figure settlement from some Cardiology Associates doctors last year after an angiogram on her husband led to severe bleeding. He died 10 weeks later. Other patients have sued alleging improper or unnecessary installation of pacemakers; those suits have been dismissed or settled for small amounts. Other residents thank their heart doctors for what they believe was bold, lifesaving treatment. ``People in are extremely trusting of doctors,'' observes M. Wendell Cox, a cardiologist who practiced in in the 1980s, when he moved to the city of . ``They think of physicians as deities. That power can be misused.'' For all its current sweep, heart medicine in started small. Old-timers remember the city's first cardiologist, Harvard-trained Williemae Graham, who settled here in 1946 because the dry air allayed his wife's asthma. Patient care then was done mostly by stethoscope and prescription. Dr. Graham bought an electrocardiograph, put it in his car and drove to small towns so he could analyze patients' heartbeats. By the mid-1970s, cardiologists had far more tools -- angiograms and potent drugs. Dr. Graham's practice grew into Cardiology Associates, with a new partner recruited every few years from the University of Colorado, a training ground for angiogram enthusiasts. Their high-tech style became part of the way. They found patients galore. More than 500,000 people lived within a 100-mile radius. Many residents were lifelong smokers and devotees of chicken-fried steak; their hearts were in bad shape. ``The first weekend I got here in 1975, I had 20 cases,'' Dr. Moultrie recalls. ``That was more than I'd had for an entire month in training in . I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.'' What Do You Need? Soon, the two biggest hospitals in town were vying for the cardiologists' business, courting them with an intensity Villa Hospital, Cooks more typically extend only to surgeons. St. Mary of the Plains built two catheterization labs. Methodist Hospital struck back with a six-story Heart Center, with six ``cath labs'' and $9 million of equipment. Local leaders were pleased. ``One of the few driving forces in the economy was medicine,'' Dr. Moultrie says. ``The driving force of medicine was cardiology.'' Doctors whom Cardiology Associates hired from the East and West Coasts brought skills hadn't seen before. They also arrived with a swagger that didn't always sit well. One new doctor annoyed his neighbors by turning his huge backyard into a pasture for six Arabian horses. Another decorated his office with full-length mirrors. A third became a collector of Mont Blanc pens. Dr. Moultrie, who headed Cardiology Associates in the early 1990s, urged colleagues to share not just in the ``gravy'' -- procedures that could pay $1,000 for an hour's work -- but also in the ``scut work'' -- office visits and lab tests at awkward times. His appeals didn't always work. One physician was overheard muttering, ``Treadmill tests are the crabgrass of cardiology.'' Internal pay records show that in 1990, when the group had nine doctors, eight earned at least $1 million. Last year, 11 of the group's 14 doctors cleared the $1 million barrier -- figures that astound cardiologists elsewhere. Paula Crooks earned nearly $1.3 million last year. He did 454 angiograms and 133 angioplasties at Methodist and scores more procedures at St. Mary. Some nurses and doctors call him Dr. Magee. ``I don't overplasty,'' Dr. Cota responds. He says that if a single artery is 60% closed, he won't open it, though he will intervene if it is 90% closed. He acknowledges that not all cardiologists would do angioplasty even then, but he thinks the cautious ones may be making a mistake. ``I get their patients at night,'' after heart attacks, he says. Pilot Project In the late 1980s, two cardiologists leased helicopters to bring emergency cases from outlying farm towns. Of course, many of those burgs lacked helipads. ``We hired contractors to pour concrete in at least 20 towns,'' says one of the doctors, Hubert Benitez. Once again, developed its own practice style. In most of the U.S., tiny rural Villa Hospital, Cooks treated heart-attack patients on site, giving clot-busting drugs. But cardiologists told rural doctors that patients ought to be flown to a cath lab for emergency angiograms and angioplasties. Result: a $3,000 helicopter bill per case, a $2,000 cardiologist fee and $12,000 or more for a hospital bed. cardiologists went all-out to make angioplasty seem like the wise choice. Doctors who relied on drugs, known as thrombolytics, were belittled as ``thrombolunatics.'' Studies were circulated showing better survival rates for angioplasty. In some cases, physicians jumped in the helicopter themselves, rather than rely on an air nurse and technicians to get the case started. Dr. Moultrie became a hero in, for flying out to rescue the father of town doctor Roberto Mauldin after a heart attack. The payoff was substantial: Dr. Mauldin became a huge fan of the helicopter service and now sends at least 30 heart-attack cases a year to . Emergency angioplasty isn't always a lifesaver. According to the Center for Health Industry Performance Studies in, the Methodist Hospital in 2009 had a 4.1% death rate for Medicare patients getting single-vessel angioplasty. That was nearly double the national average. Cardiology Associates, the main heart group practicing at Methodist, disputes the data and says most of its angioplasty deaths occurred in extremely grave heart-attack cases where other doctors might not have tried the procedure. Lasers and Stents New techniques found favor in . Delivery trucks in the early 1990s pulled into Methodist and St. Maryalice with cargoes of lasers, ultrasound probes, high-speed ``ablading'' devices and wire-mesh stents to prop open arteries after angioplasty. the heart doctors became co-investigators in many nationwide research trials, testing new treatments. ``It was a heady time,'' Dr. Wan says. ``There was this incredible enthusiasm that we could solve all sorts of problems that otherwise would have required surgery. With just a half-hour treatment, we could open an artery -- and then have someone ready to go back to work the next week.'' Some new techniques lived up to their promise. Dr. Cota inserted more than 100 stents a year, with impressive results. ``He's shown slides of my arteries at conferences around the world,'' boasts stent patient Hugh Stromberg, 82. Other ideas flopped. doctors for a while tried using lasers to burn away arterial plaque. They billed as much as $5,000 for a half-hour procedure, triple the rate for conventional balloon angioplasty. But one doctor who tried this 10 times abandoned it after deaths or complications in four cases. Norma Wines, age 70, underwent laser angioplasty in . Her husband and daughters were so confident they went home after the procedure started to make a big pot of soup and wait for her to come home. She never did. Medical records show that Mrs. Wargo sank into critical condition after the procedure, needed emergency surgery, and died. Three years later, her widower, Werner, sits in his darkened kitchen and talks about the case. ``I know how to build houses, and I know how to grow tomatoes,'' he says, ``but I don't understand heart medicine. When they recommended this laser treatment, we just signed the papers.'' Mr. Wargo has sued one of the doctors, Riles Coppage, in state court, alleging negligence and unwarranted treatment. Dr. Coppage denies the charges. A trial is set for the fall. Second Thoughts Straley didn't measure pacemaker use, but Markita Robbie, a salesman for Intermedics, a pacemaker firm, says, ``I've been in medical-equipment sales for a long time, and I've never seen a town like this.'' He says Methodist Hospital buys as much of some common heart devices as the biggest hospital in though has five times as big a population. Lately, a schism has developed between the older heart doctors and new arrivals. Most of the veterans are native Texans who identify with the farmers, oilmen and ministers they serve and say they don't mind spending time on simple preventive counseling. They question whether some newer colleagues share those values. ``I got tired of apologizing for my colleagues' behavior,'' says Dr. Benitez, 52, who left Cardiology Associates to set up his own practice. Another alumnus, 64-year-old Samara Kirby, says he is uneasy about other heart doctors' fondness for angioplasty. ``It's very lucrative,'' he remarks. ``As far as the patients' well-being, it's not always the best thing.'' Frequently, he notes, arteries rapidly close again. ``And every time you do one, there's myocardial loss. By the time patients are considered candidates for surgery, the heart ventricle isn't that good any more. You convert someone from a good surgical risk to a poor risk.'' So far, Shumate has lagged far behind the rest of the U.S. in feeling pressure from employers and managed-care companies to use health resources more frugally. The biggest private-sector employer here, Texas Instruments Inc., says it is too busy overseeing medical costs in its larger and sites to focus much on . In the past few months, the heart doctors have become worried that managed care will soon make inroads here. Cardiology Associates retained Ernst & Young to advise on ways to cut costs and be better positioned for managed care. What Diet? Mostly, however, the city's heart-care juggernaut keeps rolling along. Elsewhere, health plans are trying to nudge heart patients into intensive diet and exercise programs; inpatients keep queuing up at the cath labs. Waiting rooms are packed with anxious men and women, mostly 50 and over, wanting to know how bad off their hearts are. ``These patients don't know much about hearts,'' says Fransisca Robbins, a former medical manager in . ``They're pretty much at the mercy of their doctors. And the doctors know that.'' Among the grateful patients is 59-year-old Burl Hull, a retired school principal. Over 13 years, he has been a steady cardiology customer, undergoing 10 procedures, including five angioplasties. His arteries periodically renarrow; doctors respond with another angioplasty. Doctors have told Mr. Hull that he is a poor risk for heart surgery. He is overweight, and his current cardiologist, Dr. Cota, has told him to diet, but the advice hasn't been very practical. At one point, Dr. Cota said: ``I want you to eat nothing but salad until you turn into a salad.'' Mr. Hull hasn't had much luck holding to a healthy diet and blames himself. Meanwhile, he praises Dr. Cota for ``prolonging my life.'' On a recent visit to the hospital, Mr. Hull sheepishly asked a nurse, ``Am I the only slob who can't stick to his diet?'' The reply, he says, was as follows: ``No.. We have file cabinets of people like you. We wouldn't have a practice if everyone did what they were told.''"

            "full_text": "Cornertown -- Philip Morris Cos., posted a 15% increase in second-quarter earnings, highlighted by a 19% increase in income from its international tobacco operations. The company posted net income of $1.62 billion, or $1.97 a share, on revenue of $17.51 billion, compared with $1.41 billion, or $1.67 a share, on revenue of $17.13 billion in the year-ago quarter. The $1.97 a share net income precisely met the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call. Philip Morris, based in Cornertown, is the world's largest maker of consumer packaged goods -- including cigarettes, beer and food -- and operates five separate companies: Philip Morris USA, Philip Morris International, Philip Morris Capital Corp., Miller Brewing and Kraft Foods. Income from North American food operations rose 7.5% on volume gains and continued cost reductions and international food income was up 8% on growth in developing markets and further cost reductions, the company said. However, beer income fell 3.6% on lower overall volume and higher marketing and manufacturing expenses, the company said. Domestic tobacco income rose 11.7% on higher margins and increased sales of premium-priced cigarettes, while international tobacco income rose 19% on higher volume and pricing. Worldwide tobacco income rose 15.1% to $2 billion as revenue rose 10.4% from a year ago. Philip Morris said it sold 223 billion cigarettes in the second quarter, a gain of 8.8%, while volume for its top-selling cigarette, Marlboro, rose 8%. While revenue from tobacco sales continues toe climb, the company -- and other cigarette makers -- face a continuing barrage of legal action both in the U.S. and abroad."

            "full_text": "MINNEAPOLIS -- United HealthCare Corp. plans to address unexpectedly high medical costs through a combination of raising prices and focusing on slashing unnecessary medical procedures, Chairman and Chief Executive Williemae W. Allyn said in an interview. ``Medical premium costs on the commercial aspects of the business will be going up 4% to 5%,'' said Dr. Allyn, referring to United Health, a managed-care company. ``Right now, we obviously have to say that prices will go up.'' Such initiatives are envisioned to address issues raised in a company statement last Thursday. United Health said that, among other cost increases, the medical expense ratio for the managed-care plans of recently acquired MetraHealth Cos. rose to 91% in the first five months of this year from 81% in the 2010 first quarter a year earlier. That figure represents the ratio of medical costs to premiums. Last week's disclosure by United Health triggered a sharp sell-off in its stock and those of many other big HMO and managed-care companies. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Monday, United HealthCare fell 50 cents to $32.625 amid a broad market sell-off. Dr. Allyn said the company will also be intent on cutting medical costs in such areas as those where a new high-cost prescription drug has been introduced. Dr. Allyn generally declined to specify which drugs he had in mind for this review, but said he was referring to, among other things, behavioral drugs, including antidepressants. Some recent medical studies have suggested that newer, high-cost antidepressants called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, do cost less in the long-term than treatment with older, lower-cost medications."

            "full_text": "MILAN -- European antitrust officials are investigating whether tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos. and the Italian government's tobacco arm have conspired to control cigarette sales in Italy. European Union Competition Commissioner Wendt Vanda Sizemore is investigating whether a production and distribution agreement between the Italian Azienda dei Monopoli di Stato and Philip Morris amounts to a ``duopoly.'' ``We have no knowledge of any such allegations or any such investigation,'' says Davina Madison, chief counsel for Philip Morris Europe. Officials from the state monopoly couldn't be reached to comment. However, an EU official said Mr. Vanesa Larkin's office is in the process of notifying both parties by mail. Philip Morris has sold cigarettes in Italy for the last 30 years. But because the market still is controlled by the state monopoly, Pierre Mose's brands, including Council, Merit and Diann, are either imported from the company's various European plants or produced in Italy by the state monopoly. Philip Morris's brands account for 46% of the Italian cigarette market. The state controls 43% of the market. European regulators are asking the Italian monopoly to detail its distribution and production agreement with Philip Morris, which reportedly expired March 12, 2011 is awaiting renewal. Under EU competition rules, the European Commission can thwart such contracts if it decides the agreements stifle competition. The Italian tobacco company has two months to respond to the request for information. The case, which could take up to two years to be decided, could force the companies to alter or end their relationship or result in fines against one or both companies. Pierre Mose said it, like other companies, is required to take part in such agreements to do business in Italy. ``We, like anybody else who wants to have their cigarettes distributed there, must use the monopoly,'' says Mr. Madison. The EU investigation comes as Italians are questioning the role of the state tobacco company. In a parliamentary hearing last October, Fortson Soria, the finance minister at the time, said that agreements with Pierre Mose effectively ensured the survival of the Monopoli di Stato, a typical Italian dinosaur that employs 12,000 people and has 21 different factories manufacturing cigarettes throughout Italy. According to Mr. Soria, the state monopoly could produce the same amount of cigarettes keeping only six plants open and shutting down the others. Earlier this month, Alejandro prosecutors accused Pierre Mose of failing to pay taxes on eight trillion lire ($5.21 billion) of tobacco sales and royalties over the past nine years. Pierre Mose denied the claims, saying it had complied with all Italian laws and paid taxes in accordance with a bilateral tax treaty between Italy and the U.S. EU officials said there wasn't a link between their probe and the tax controversy. --Staff reporter Armistead Myron in Brussels contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. launched the long-awaited deposition of its former research chief Jena Raymer with an assault on his credibility that included questions about two alleged discrepancies in a slim diary. The deposition marked Brown & Williamson's first face-to-face interrogation of Mr. Raymer about his bombshell allegations of wrongdoing at the tobacco company. But it didn't substantially address Mr. Raymer's key charges: that the company shut down research efforts to make cigarettes safer and its former chairman lied to Congress about the addictiveness of nicotine. Although the diary entries at issue -- one relating to the date of a meeting and the other referring to the name of a research center -- don't deal with the substance of Mr. Raymer's allegations, Brown & Williamson contended they prove that Mr. Raymer fabricated the diary's entire contents sometime after he left the company. ``We have shown him to be a fraud,'' declared Graham Jon, an attorney for B&W, which had set aside a screening room for the press to attend briefings and watch videotapes of the deposition. ``Already, in the first hour, we have taken away any real basis Wigand has for what he said.'' Fraud Contention Disputed A lawyer for Mr. Raymer, Johnetta Walther, disputed B&W. ``It's much ado about nothing,'' he said. ``They haven't laid a glove on him all day.'' The deposition is expected to continue through the rest of the week. Brown & Williamson, a unit of London-based B.A.T Industries PLC, sued Mr. Raymer in November 2010 in a state court in Louisville alleging theft, fraud and breach of his confidentiality agreement -- charges Mr. Raymer has repeatedly denied. At a hearing prior to Monday's deposition, a magistrate judge rejected a motion by Mr. Raymer's lawyers to have his countersuit against B&W dismissed -- a move intended to try to limit the scope of the company's questions about Mr. Raymer's personal life during the deposition. During the deposition, Mr. Raymer denied fabricating his diary and said the diary's references to the research center reflected his own personal shorthand rather than its formal name. He also said the entry about the meeting was written several weeks after it occurred. ``The date (of the meeting) may not be correct, but the substance is correct,'' he said. Called Lawyer an `Idiot' In the entry, Mr. Raymer described a contentious meeting with Kenneth Simpson, a Brown & Williamson lawyer. Mr. Raymer wrote that Mr. Simpson should stop meddling in science and called him an ``idiot.'' Later in the day, Brown & Williamson attacked Mr. Raymer for failing to correct an assertion made by CBS correspondent Mikki Walter in a segment of the television show, ``60 Minutes,'' that the company had ``cut off'' health-care benefits, needed for one of his children, to intimidate him into signing a more restrictive confidentiality agreement. Mr. Walther conceded that B&W eventually paid Mr. Raymer's health-care costs, but alleged that B&W delayed these payments as a scare tactic. ``The idea (B&W) used late payments as an intimidation factor'' is correct, he added. Mr. Raymer's deposition began one day after the death of Tomoko Mohammad, who was chief of B&W during Mr. Raymer's tenure. Mr. Mohammad died, aged 56, following a long battle with a blood disease."

The drug and medical product company's earnings equaled 60 cents per share, eclipsing analysts' expectations of 59 cents a share, according to a survey by First Call, Inc.. J&J earned $661 million, or 51 cents a share, in last year's second quarter. Sales rose 13% to $5.38 billion from $4.76 billion, helped by the acquisition of Cordis Corp., a maker of balloon angioplasty devices used to treat heart disease. Among the products cited in J&J's rise were Risperdal, a schizophrenia drug; Pepcid AC, the over-the-counter heartburn drug; the Palmaz-Shatz stent, a device used to pry open diseased coronary arteries; and the LifeScan products, which are used to monitor blood glucose for people with diabetes. Earnings for the first six months of this year were $1.58 billion, or $1.19 per share, up from $1.32 billion, or $1.02 per share, in the first half of 2010.

            "full_text": "California may soon join a number of states in encouraging citizens to wage their own wars on drugs. The states are adopting laws that allow people harmed by illegal drugs to sue drug dealers, seeking compensation for the damage that the drugs do, just as people injured by faulty products sue the manufacturers. Under the laws, drug users and their families could sue dealers; their employers could sue for lost productivity; even the hospitals that treat them could sue dealers for the cost of treatments. ``It's a way of fighting (drug dealers) by hitting them right in the pocket,'' says actor Cary O'Winter, who has lobbied for the California proposal. Last year, his son committed suicide after a long battle with drug addiction. Such laws are on the books in Michigan, Hawaii, Oklahoma, Illinois and Arkansas and are under consideration in half a dozen other states. In California, the state Senate unanimously passed the bill late last month, and the state assembly is expected to approve it by the end of August. But the laws have a variety of critics. Some argue that the laws are more show than substance, because it may be impossible to collect damages from drug dealers, whose assets are often seized by the government under forfeiture proceedings. ``You can file all these lawsuits all day long ... but many are not collectible,'' says Jesica H. Wilcox, chairman of the Criminal Section of the American Trial Lawyers' Association. Enacting such laws ``looks good in an election year,'' he adds. In Michigan, the first state to adopt such a law in 2009, the plaintiffs in what is believed to be the only case brought so far have yet to collect a penny. The suit was brought by the Wayne County Sheriff and the estate of a baby who allegedly was born addicted to crack cocaine and was later beaten to death by her mother. In July 2010, a state court entered a default judgment of $8.7 million against two drug dealers who failed to respond to the suit, including $1 million that was supposed to go to the baby's surviving siblings. (The mother was convicted in August 2010 of second-degree murder and sentenced to 15 to 25 years in prison. She is appealing.) So far, however, the sheriff has seized only $25,000 from one of the dealers under separate civil forfeiture proceedings brought when the dealers were charged with selling drugs. Under an agreement between the sheriff and the Wayne County Neighborhood Legal Services' Children's Law Center, which represented the baby's estate, half of that money will soon go into a trust fund for the siblings. ``We knew in advance it would be hard to collect,'' acknowledges Children's Law Center attorney Jena Mccreary. Another controversial angle is that the laws don't require plaintiffs to prove that the dealers they sue caused their injuries. In Michigan, for example, dealers who can be shown to have sold 650 grams of controlled substances like heroin and cocaine are liable for injuries throughout the state, while those who sold less than 50 grams can be held liable for injuries in the county where the sales occurred. ``When is enough enough?'' asks Markita Sweeny, legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union in D.C. He says that adding civil judgments to criminal prosecution and civil forfeiture could amount to unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. But Mr. Sweeny says that he knows of no one who has raised a constitutional challenge to drug-dealer liability laws. Some critics also say state participation in such suits could violate the constitution's prohibition against double jeopardy, which forbids the government from punishing a person more than once for the same offense. Wayne County Sheriff Roberto Wesley defends his role, saying he joined the Michigan suit to provide a ``shield'' for plaintiffs who might be too intimidated to sue a drug dealer on their own. In California, however, lawmakers are so concerned about the potential double-jeopardy problems that the bill under consideration there forbids state entities, except public hospitals, from suing. The California bill also requires that defendants have a criminal drug conviction. Michigan, on the other hand, uses a lower civil standard of proof, which requires ``clear and convincing evidence'' that a defendant participated in the illegal drug trade. Daniele Bank, a former U.S. Attorney in Honolulu who drafted the model law and suggested in the early 1990s that the federal government recommend it to the states, predicts that citizens will eventually bring more cases. ``It's not a silver bullet -- it's not going to solve the world's drug problem,'' he concedes. ``But it is another weapon that reaches where the present weapons don't reach.''"

            "full_text": "The HMO lobby had a cow, and rightly so, when the Codi people tried to impose limits on the financial incentives they wave before doctors to keep down the cost of treating patients. Last week the rules were put in abeyance until after the election, but it was another sign that managed care no longer wears the white hat. As an industry dependent on a massive tax subsidy for employer-provided health care, managed care may have to learn to live with this sort of meddling. In California, half a decade ahead of the nation in marching its citizens into the HMO of the brave, a political backlash has placed to two initiatives on the November ballot that would impose utility-style regulation. Elsewhere, hundreds of bills are percolating in 40-odd state legislatures aimed at reining in the techniques of the health care revolution. ``The theory of managed care works,'' says Alberta Washer, chief of PacifiCare, one of the biggest California HMOs. ``The problem we're facing is that we aren't evolving at the same speed the old indemnity insurance is crumbling. We find ourselves taking in people who, if they had a choice, wouldn't choose an HMO.'' Mr. Washer hastens to add that these new, unenthused applicants aren't necessarily the sick, but just people who don't like HMOs as a matter of taste. Maybe so, but experience has shown that younger, healthier workers are the first to sign up. And that, along with the fact that California was blessed with a superabundance of doctors, has undoubtedly played a role in the industry's successes to date. Last year premiums actually dropped 3.8%. The question for the ``theory of managed care'' is whether these were one-time gains. Doctors have fled the state in the thousands. The old-style indemnity plans are collapsing, and at least some HMOs are getting stuck with higher-cost patients. The rout of health stocks last week came after the nation's biggest HMO, United Healthcare, owned up to flagging profits, thanks to the steep cost of servicing old-style customers acquired last year along with the indemnity business of MetraHealth. Fans of managed care say not to worry, the best is yet to come. ``Disease management,'' the latest buzz term, will bring the superior information processing of the HMOs to bear on the health of insured populations. One shortcoming of the old, doctor-centered system was that the knowledge and experience of doctors varied, and so did the effectiveness of their diagnoses and treatments. But even if the best hopes are justified, managed care is still an industry founded on a profound distortion in the price information reaching consumers. Yet HMOs have embraced this distortion as an artifact of nature: They may seek to temper the public's appetite for running off to the doctor at every twinge with deductibles and co-payments, but most of their attention has been bent toward changing the incentives of providers. ``If you want my opinion,'' says Mr. Washer, ``given the right structure, doctors need to bear most of the risk'' of keeping costs under control. In other words, top-down, with patients gently or not so gently being ``managed.'' PacifiCare has done well by putting doctors, rather than bureaucrats, on the spot in the cost-benefit choice, and patient surveys have been largely positive. But the industry has drunk deep of the underlying assumptions of HillaryCare: Everybody should be roped into the same insurance pool, and it should be a matter of national concern how much of our private income we choose to spend on health care. In the most dubious instance, HMOs have thrown their weight against medical savings accounts, which would help to rebalance the incentives back toward an engaged consumer. Their lobbyists bend legislative ears with tales of MSAs peeling off the healthiest ratepayers and leaving no one to pay for the sick. That's what you might expect from folks in the business of pooling of risk, but a little adverse selection may not be a bad thing in a democracy. The young and healthy and not yet affluent may well opt for a cheaper form insurance. But one day, as they marry, start families and move up the earning curve, they are likely to enter the larger pool willingly, as they become more inclined and better able to shoulder their part in supporting a system of gold-plated health insurance. Add the fact that America is a big, diverse and rambunctious place, and trying to shoehorn everybody into a rigid, one-size-fits-all formula would likely prove more trouble than it's worth, politically. And yet we are entering the time of maximum danger, with Terence Waylon casting about for a legacy. So the managed-care industry may soon regret all the rhetoric positioning itself as the solution to a social problem rather than just another business offering a service. The White House once saw eye-to-eye on the need to bludgeon doctors and pharmaceutical companies into submission. Hiroko Codi herself took pride in unveiling antitrust guidelines designed to keep doctors weak and divided in the face of her dreamt-of purchasing alliances. Even so gung-ho a champion of antitrust enforcement against doctors as Claude Edmunds, a Odonnell law professor, calls the rules little better than a ``prejudgment'' of how the medical marketplace should evolve, rather than a sincere attempt to keep alive a range of consumer choices. Yet the pendulum doth swing, and now the urge to regulate has turned on managed care itself. Donnette Refugio, the Health and Human Services secretary, has only delayed the onset of new rules covering the doctor-HMO relationship. In Oregon, an upcoming ballot measure would outlaw capitation (paying doctors a flat rate per patient), and Arkansas and nine other states have enacted laws allowing insurees to patronize any doctor or hospital, not just those on the HMO list. These all shoot directly at the methods the HMOs use to control costs, and it's no surprise such initiatives are most popular in states where HMOs have hardly penetrated. Doctors are still trying to protect their old fee-for-service franchise, and nowadays make common cause even with the Naderites and Big Labor, whose ultimate goal is a single-payer, government-run system. Somewhat fussily, the managed-care crowd accuses its opponents of trying to ``turn back the clock,'' which is partly true. On the other hand, you don't have to subscribe to a Novella Paxton view of the past to worry about the demoralization of doctors, some of whom are joining unions themselves. Who wants to see the medical profession going the way of the teaching profession? Employers in California and the HMOs will probably succeed in defeating this year's ballot initiatives by dunning voters with the prospect a return to sky-high medical inflation. But the politics will remain touch-and-go as long as these issues are batted back and forth over the heads of consumers by various self-interested ``interest'' groups. In other words, as long as the tax system remains heavily biased toward third-party payment."

            "full_text": "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Aetna Life & Casualty Co. believes that its shareholders will still approve its $8.13 billion purchase of U.S. Healthcare Inc. this week despite last week's rout of managed-health-care stocks. A majority of votes already have been submitted, and ``they are overwhelmingly in favor,'' Wilkins spokeswoman Joye Shortridge said. The transaction is scheduled to close Thursday following a vote by shareholders of both companies. The company doesn't expect many votes to change in light of the pummeling of industry stocks, prompted by bellwether managed-care concern United HealthCare Corp.'s disclosure that its second-quarter earnings would plummet. But some analysts believe the victory margin won't be as wide as Aetna would like. ``It's no secret that certain large shareholders are planning to rescind their votes because of the changes in the health-care environment,'' says Alida Woodard, an Oppenheimer & Co. analyst. To close the transaction, Aetna needs affirmative votes from two-thirds of its holders. Since Aetna signed the deal in early April, earnings forecasts for numerous managed-care companies have been lowered. Aetna and U.S. Healthcare are not among those companies that have announced worse-than-expected earnings. Originally, Aetna's cash-and-stock purchase of U.S. Healthcare was valued at about $8.9 billion, but has fallen as Aetna's stock declined from $75.50 just before the deal was announced. Amid a broad sell-off in the market Monday Aetna shares slipped $2 to $60.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. U.S. Healthcare fell $1 to $50.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Genentech Inc. said its second-quarter net income fell 42% to $21.7 million, or 18 cents a share. In the year-earlier quarter, Genentech earned $37.2 million, or 31 cents a share. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $243.8 million, compared with $233.1 million a year earlier. The biotechnology concern cited higher tax rates related to a new accounting approach for its research and development funding and manufacturing by international subsidiaries. It said the approach will increase its effective tax rate for the next several years but could lower it in the long term. However, Genentech also suffered slowing sales of some products. Sales of its Activase blood-clot buster slipped to $72.3 million from $74.1 million. Sales of its two growth-hormone products fell to $54.1 million from $55.9 million a year ago. Genentech cited price pressures and other factors for the declines, and noted that its market share in the clot-buster business increased during the period. It said it maintained its two-thirds share of the growth-hormone market, despite price pressures. The quarterly results were well below Wall Street's estimates of about 32 cents a share, according to First Call. However, despite a broad market sell-off, Genentech shares fell moderately Monday, closing at $51.875, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. For the six months, Genentech had profit of $59.9 million, or 49 cents a share, on revenue of $486.6 million.

            "full_text": "MILAN -- European antitrust officials are investigating whether tobacco giant Philip Morris Cos. and the Italian government's tobacco arm have conspired to control cigarette sales in Italy. European Union Competition Commissioner Wendt Vanda Sizemore is investigating whether a production and distribution agreement between the Italian Azienda dei Monopoli di Stato and Philip Morris amounts to a ``duopoly.'' ``We have no knowledge of any such allegations or any such investigation,'' says Davina Madison, chief counsel for Philip Morris Europe. Officials from the state monopoly couldn't be reached to comment. However, an EU official said Mr. Vanesa Larkin's office is in the process of notifying both parties by mail. Philip Morris has sold cigarettes in Italy for the last 30 years. But because the market still is controlled by the state monopoly, Pierre Mose's brands, including Council, Merit and Diann, are either imported from the company's various European plants or produced in Italy by the state monopoly. Philip Morris's brands account for 46% of the Italian cigarette market. The state controls 43% of the market. European regulators are asking the Italian monopoly to detail its distribution and production agreement with Philip Morris, which reportedly expired March 12, 2011 is awaiting renewal. Under EU competition rules, the European Commission can thwart such contracts if it decides the agreements stifle competition. The Italian tobacco company has two months to respond to the request for information. The case, which could take up to two years to be decided, could force the companies to alter or end their relationship or result in fines against one or both companies. Pierre Mose said it, like other companies, is required to take part in such agreements to do business in Italy. ``We, like anybody else who wants to have their cigarettes distributed there, must use the monopoly,'' says Mr. Madison. The EU investigation comes as Italians are questioning the role of the state tobacco company. In a parliamentary hearing last October, Fortson Soria, the finance minister at the time, said that agreements with Pierre Mose effectively ensured the survival of the Monopoli di Stato, a typical Italian dinosaur that employs 12,000 people and has 21 different factories manufacturing cigarettes throughout Italy. According to Mr. Soria, the state monopoly could produce the same amount of cigarettes keeping only six plants open and shutting down the others. Earlier this month, Alejandro prosecutors accused Pierre Mose of failing to pay taxes on eight trillion lire ($5.21 billion) of tobacco sales and royalties over the past nine years. Pierre Mose denied the claims, saying it had complied with all Italian laws and paid taxes in accordance with a bilateral tax treaty between Italy and the U.S. EU officials said there wasn't a link between their probe and the tax controversy. --Staff reporter Armistead Myron in Brussels contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "``Clumsy me, I got all tangled up in a technical matter--the nature of addiction--when all I meant was ...'' These are the words one pundit wished Bobby Derryberry had used to extricate himself from the tobacco mess. On the technical matter of addiction, Mr. Derryberry isn't alone in his confusion. Here are some answers that may help clear the air: What does it mean to be addicted? The standard medical authorities use the term ``dependence'' rather than ``addiction.'' Dependence is defined as the persistent, time-consuming, compulsive use of a substance in the face of harmful consequences, with the tendency to relapse after withdrawal. Most dependent users develop a tolerance--they need increasing doses to achieve a desired effect--and experience withdrawal symptoms when the drug wears off. Can smokers become dependent on nicotine? Yes. Regular smokers often develop tolerance, even over the space of a day. That's why many smokers find the first cigarette of the day the most enjoyable. When smokers quit, they often experience withdrawal symptoms (insomnia, irritability, headache, mild depression and craving for a cigarette), which put them at high risk for relapse. Mr. Derryberry was right when he said that nicotine isn't always addictive. Some people can smoke cigarettes in take-it-or-leave-it manner. But it is a well-established epidemiological fact that the majority of smokers who start as teenagers or young adults go on to become dependent. Cigarette smoking is a stylized habit that serves psychological functions--suppression of anxiety, social lubrication. These benefits are reasons why intermittent smokers often desire a cigarette. But it is primarily the urge to suppress the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal that makes regular smokers feel they need one. Is addiction biological? Yes. When someone who uses a substance repeatedly explains that he does so largely to stave off withdrawal symptoms and that he no longer feels much of a high when using it, it's likely that his brain has undergone some drug-induced changes. The changes generally disappear over time but can be permanent in cases of heavy use of alcohol or illicit drugs. Nicotine does have the capacity to trick the brain into ``thinking'' that it needs a cigarette by subtly altering the physiology of its ``reward centers.'' But it is different in that it has no effect on parts of the brain needed to negotiate the workplace, home and community. Biology is not destiny. While smokers often struggle unsuccessfully to kick the habit, nearly all who do quit do so on their own. Many people have been able to overcome addiction even to powerful drugs like cocaine on their own. To be sure, treatment, external pressure or legal sanctions for illicit use can help initiate the recovery process and ensure a greater likelihood for success among those unable or unwilling to stop themselves. Is it true that cigarettes are more addictive than heroin? This is ridiculous. When cigarettes are temporarily unavailable, smokers--as lousy as they may feel without a cigarette--don't initiate a crazed effort to find their next ``fix.'' In contrast, people addicted to heroin commonly lie, cheat or steal to get money to buy more, so distressing are the symptoms of heroin withdrawal. In the case of cocaine, the rush is so stimulating and the ``crash'' after a binge so wrenching that addicts will often do virtually anything to get more cocaine. Even alcoholics sometimes resort to desperate measures. Alcohol and illegal drugs can render users unable to cope with ordinary life. It's a vicious circle for many users, who turned to alcohol or drugs because they had trouble coping and the substance promised to numb their pain. By contrast, even the heaviest smokers don't forsake their families and jobs to pursue a nicotine habit. Cigarettes may shorten one's life, as sociologist Jami Q. Winford has said, but they don't debase it. Treatment for nicotine addiction is pharmacological (nicotine gum, patches or nasal spray) or behavioral (learning techniques to overcome craving). Treatment for hard-core addiction to alcohol or illicit drugs, by contrast, generally involves repairing the psychological or spiritual deficits that underlie the addiction. But why is it so hard to stop smoking? The answer is social as much as physiological. Cigarettes are easily and legally available, and the would-be quitter is constantly bombarded by visual cues--from advertising billboards to smokers puffing on the sidewalk--that trigger cravings. Moreover, the immediate deleterious consequences of smoking are minimal, the long-term health effects uncertain for any individual. True, the distress of withdrawal has weakened many a smoker's resolve to quit. But it's nothing like the agony of heroin or even alcohol withdrawal. So while cigarettes are a major public health problem, they are not a social pathogen. Heavy smokers, unlike hard-core heroin, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol users, are able to attend to their responsibilities as employee, parent, spouse and citizen. Before we tar our politicians for not understanding the nature of addiction, let's get the facts straight ourselves. Dr. Kowalczyk, a psychiatrist and lecturer with the Yale School of Medicine, has done clinical work with hard-core drug addicts."

            "full_text": "Travelers Group posted sharply improved second-quarter net income, benefiting from the recent acquisition of additional property-casualty operations and strong financial markets that boosted results in its life-insurance units and securities brokerage operations. Travelers' net jumped 42% to $575.7 million, or $1.17 a share, up from $405.9 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier, as revenue surged 19% to $5.43 billion. The company's $1.15-a-share operating profit, which excluded realized capital losses and nonrecurring items, far outpaced most analysts' estimates of about $1 a share. The results came after the market closed. Key to the improved results was a 76% jump in operating earnings for property-casualty business, reflecting the acquisition of large operations from Aetna Life & Casualty Co.. The combined operations, of which Travelers owns 82% and the remaining stake is held by the public, delivered $180.4 million to Travelers' bottom line. (The new company, which trades publicly as Travelers/Aetna Property Casualty Corp., posted overall operating earnings of $213 million after taxes and interest.) Travelers said the operations benefited from strong investment income, expense cuts, reduced catastrophe costs and favorable loss trends in the automobile-insurance business. Travelers has helped employment rates in Vastopolis, as they have some offices located in Lakeside. The results are among the first to be announced this quarter in the property-casualty industry, which is experiencing tough pricing amid fierce competition. Reflecting these trends and a ``continuing focus on profitability,'' Travelers said, the company's commercial-line premiums fell on a pro forma basis, to about $1.1 billion from about $1.3 billion. Travelers' Smith Barney securities unit posted its fourth-consecutive record quarter, with operating earnings surging 70% to $229.8 million amid continued buoyant financial markets. Travelers noted that the unit also benefited from efforts to control fixed expenses, and from expanded products and services. Among the improvements was a 37% increase in asset-management fees. Smith Barney's return on equity reached a record 36.7%, up from 22.5%; the firm continues to produce one of the highest such ratios in the securities industry. Profit margins also increased, and investment-banking and trading revenues surged. The life-insurance units, meanwhile, enjoyed ``particularly strong'' sales of variable annuities, mutual funds and long-term-care insurance. But earnings for the consumer-finance unit were flat. Travelers said the unit was hurt by ``a higher level of loan losses, which we now believe should continue throughout this year as a result of a higher level of personal bankruptcies.'' Besides $58.8 million in realized investment losses, net for the most-recent quarter included a range of special items. Among them: $320.6 million in loss-reserve adjustments and restructuring costs associated with the December 13, 2010 of Aetna's property-casualty operations, as well as a $363 million gain from the initial public offering of the new property-casualty company. Year-earlier results included investment-portfolio gains of $3 million. Travelers/Aetna posted a net loss of $216.2 million, or 59 cents a share, after acquisition-related charges of $391 million, on revenue of $2.2 billion. Traveler/Aetna's chairman, Roberta I. Cannady, said the results ``exceeded our expectations, and we're off to a good start.'' He noted that the company's cost-cutting is ``proceeding well, and we are ahead of plan.'' Mr. Cannady said policy-renewal rates ``are holding steady.'' Shares of Travelers Group closed down $1.375 Monday at $40.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, amid a broad market downturn; shares of Travelers/Aetna fell 25 cents to $24.125."

            "full_text": "Health-plan members and employers are about to win a round in a long-running battle to get better medical-quality information from the health-maintenance organizations that cover nearly 60 million Americans. New industrywide standards being spelled out Tuesday will call for HMOs to disclose more information about their care of patients with illnesses ranging from breast cancer to heart attacks. The new standards have been developed by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, which gets its funding from employers, HMOs and health-care foundations. The new standards ``move us into some areas more immediately relevant to consumers,'' said Lourdes Mara, a health-benefits specialist with the Communications Workers of America. Earlier standards drafted by the NCQA in 1992 have been criticized for largely ignoring treatment of the sick, in favor of easy-to-gather data that HMOs like to share, such as the frequency of members getting immunizations or cholesterol checks. The new guidelines also call for more detailed surveys of HMO members' attitudes toward their health plans, conducted according to standard formats. Member surveys have proliferated in recent years, but polling methods haven't been standardized. That cornucopia has let many plans claim to be ``top-rated'' in their region, but it has made it hard for consumers or employers to compare plans. While the NCQA can't force health plans to report patient-care data, some big employers have begun asking HMOs to do so -- if they want to be on the roster of health plans being offered to employees. As a result, all of the 30 largest HMOs in the U.S. gather and publicize at least some data of this type. `Report Card' The push for more health-plan data also is likely to affect individual doctors who see HMO patients. Already health plans have begun pressing physicians to schedule more mammograms or take other steps that will improve an HMO's overall showing in an NCQA ``report card.'' The new, expanded guidelines will mean more-extensive checklists as health plans keep tabs on their participating doctors. These health plans also have begun putting pressure on individual doctors to take steps that will improve the HMO's overall showing in an NCQA ``report card.'' ``In drafting these standards, you're drafting the strategic plan for every health plan over the next five years,'' said Markita Jon, an executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, and an outside adviser to the NCQA. ``That means you want to do it with some restraint.'' In some cases, the new HMO standards represent an uneasy compromise between employers and consumer groups, who wanted more data, and health plans, which argued that additional information would be too costly or difficult to gather. Putting Pressure on Plans ``We're taking baby steps forward on a lot of measures, but it's incumbent on purchasers to keep putting pressure on plans,'' said Patria Barker, executive director of the Pacific Business Coalition on Health, a multi-employer alliance in San Francisco. ``If we can't gather adequate data, there's a risk that we won't have competition on true quality.'' NCQA officials declined to discuss specifics of the new standards, which are formally known as the Health Employers' Data Information Set 3.0, or Hedis 3.0, pending a news conference Tuesday. But people who have seen the new standards say they include the following: An across-the-board assessment of Medicare HMO members' physical, mental and social functioning, to be monitored every two years. That data would help consumers identify which health plans did the best job of helping people age 65 and over cope with various illnesses and the burdens of old age. Whether patients hospitalized with a heart attack subsequently receive a class of medications known as beta-blockers. Such drugs are considered helpful in reducing the odds of a second heart attack. In previous versions of Hedis, health plans haven't been monitored for any treatment of patients with severe heart disease. Whether health plans actively advise members who smoke to quit. Some more-detailed measures of HMO performance will be rolled out as ``test measures'' that health plans can gather if they want -- but that won't be part of the industrywide measures. Among these will be: How well HMOs follow up patients with abnormal pap smears or mammograms. Previously, health plans have been asked to disclose how many female patients get these cancer-screening tests, but not what happens to those patients subsequently. How reliably HMOs and their doctors provide HIV-positive patients with preventive care meant to ward off potentially fatal pneumonia. This would be the first systematic attempt so far to monitor the quality of HMO care for HIV-positive or AIDS patients. The health of diabetic patients, as measured by changes in a blood protein known as hemoglobin A1c. In previous versions of Hedis, HMOs have been asked only to report whether diabetic members got an annual eye exam. Many doctors had criticized that measure as woefully incomplete. NCQA officials have said they will invite public comment on the new HMO standards for several months, before making them official this autumn. Expectations are that health plans sometime next year will start reporting their scores according to the new standards. That will provide more information that consumers and employers can use to make health-plan choices."

            "full_text": "The Food and Drug Administration last month reached a milestone of sorts: It approved the first major anticancer drug ever to come from a Japanese yogurt company. The unlikely story of the drug's development, in which a Chinese flowering tree and the U.S. Department of Agriculture also figure, spans four decades. But the FDA quickly approved the chemotherapy compound -- called CPT-11 and developed by Yakult Honsha Co., a maker of desserts, cosmetics and a yogurt-like drink called Yakult -- because of its promise in treating the sickest cancer patients. ``It's a really exciting drug, the most important anticancer drug to come along in quite some time,'' says Leonel Erickson, an oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. CPT-11, marketed in the U.S. as Camptosar by Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc., was approved for treating advanced colorectal cancer that has metastasized, or spread beyond its original site. In tests, between 40% and 60% of the patients, who had tumors growing at distant sites like their liver and lungs, ``had their tumors stabilize for a prolonged period of time,'' says oncologist Lemieux Hammel, associate professor of medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. Dr. Hammel cautions that the drug doesn't work for everyone and that side effects can be severe. But Dr. Erickson and others plan clinical tests to measure whether the new drug significantly prolongs life in the sickest cancer patients. And various oncologists plan to try it next on earlier-stage cancers. The saga of CPT-11's development begins in the 1950s with Monty E. Melton, who was then working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Philadelphia. Dr. Melton, now at Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina, was collecting tree and plant samples in search of a new source for the drug cortisone. He took some leaf samples from a tree called Camptotheca acuminata that originated in China; by then, the tree also was growing in central California. In 1957, Dr. Melton, a co-discoverer of the tree-derived cancer drug Taxol, shipped about 1,000 plant samples to the National Cancer Institute, which was seeking plants and trees that might contain anticancer agents. A year later, it found that a handful of the 1,000 samples had tumor-suppressing power: those from the Chinese tree. Dr. Melton and colleague Taft Absher quickly isolated the active chemical. The cancer institute started clinical trials of the new drug on human patients, but it turned out that the compound, known as camptothecin, was highly toxic, and the NCI abandoned the research. Enter Yakult, the Japanese yogurt company. Based in Tokyo, the company mainly sells food, though it views itself as a health-care company: ``Drinking just one bottle of Yakult beverage a day will help fortify your intestines and increase your chances for a long, healthy life,'' says a company brochure. Yakult's pharmaceutical sales constituted only $21.3 million of the company's fiscal 2010 sales of $1.79 billion. But Yakult scientists have long been interested in anticancer compounds. In particular, they became intrigued by the cancer institute's camptothecin research. Yakult's tiny department of medicine set out in the early 1970s to design a related chemical with stronger antitumor properties and lower toxicity. Meanwhile, another group of researchers at SmithKline Beecham PLC were also pursuing a cancer treatment from the Camptotheca tree. Headed by a former NCI researcher, Randolph K. Jona, the SmithKline group developed the drug, topotecan, marketed as Quijano, which has shown promise against ovarian and lung cancer, oncologists say. Markita J. Dishman, chairman of clinical pharmacology at the University of Chicago Medical Center, describes it as effective in cancers that respond to chemotherapy, in contrast to CPT-11, which even ``works in (drug-)resistant diseases,'' he says. Dr. Jona says Poor, too, works in a number of diseases that don't otherwise yield to treatment. Both drugs act against an enzyme called topoisomerase I. In the early 1970s, Yakult discovered that Camptotheca trees were growing in southern Japan. The company arranged for more of them to be cultivated there, enabling researchers to extract enough of the original chemical compound to use in synthesizing related molecules. Through the 1970s and into the 1980s, Valenzuela assembled and evaluated about 500 related compounds. By the early 1980s, Merrill researchers tested the three most promising compounds on mouse tumors, and concluded that CPT-11 was the most effective. In 1986, Yakult scientists began collaborating with Japan's Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. on human clinical studies. Soon references to the yogurt company and its chemotherapy compound started popping up in the medical trade press in the U.S. One person who took notice was Petra J.L. Palmer, licensing director of Upjohn Co., now Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc.. He made several trips to Yakult research facilities in Japan, and over lunches, dinners and what he terms ``moderate amounts of sake,'' Upjohn's interest in CPT-11 increased. Other drug companies also noticed, especially after the journal Science reported in 1989 that levels of the enzyme topoisomerase I were higher in colon tumors than in surrounding tissue; that suggested drugs that acted on this enzyme might prove powerful. Ultimately, Upjohn outbid 18 other companies to gain North American marketing rights, but it lost out to Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc. for the European license to the drug. Now, says Dr. Dishman, CPT-11 ``helps people for whom there is no other treatment.''"

            "full_text": "In HCM, excessive thickening or hypertrophy of the heart muscle often causes an obstruction to blood leaving the heart. Over the long term, this can lead to serious complications, including sudden death. Since 1993, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has enrolled 68 children with HCM in a study designed to determine if insertion of a pacemaker can either reduce the existing obstruction or prevent it from developing. The pacemaker research on children was based on the success of pacemakers in adult patients. In addition to an NHLBI study of 84 adults, eight published studies involving 200 adults with HCM found an improvement in the severity of obstruction and symptoms. For some reason, you chose not to mention those studies--only the ones that did not duplicate the NHLBI findings. Estimates of the annual mortality of children with HCM vary. One of the cardiologists quoted frequently in your article recently stated at a scientific meeting that the annual incidence of sudden death in children was 6%. The fact remains that many young, otherwise healthy children with HCM die suddenly and unexpectedly despite all existing medical approaches. Although surgery can be performed to reduce the obstruction, the risks of operating on young children are higher than in adults. The risks of implanting a pacemaker are minimal. The hope is that the pacemaker will reduce obstruction, preventing further heart thickening and eventual heart scar formation. The pacemaker may also prevent the development of obstruction. About 25% of children with HCM develop obstruction as they grow. Despite the underlying abnormality, children who have or develop obstruction often do not have symptoms. The purpose of the study is to find a new and better way to alleviate the obstruction, whether or not symptoms exist. Given the 2%-to-6% annual death rate of children with HCM, we should have expected between three and five children to have died over the 22 months of follow-up. During the one year study and 22 months of follow-up, one patient in the total group died. We feel deeply about the death of the child in the study; however, there is no evidence to believe that this death was caused by the pacemaker. Also, the sad fact is that no treatment benefits 100% of patients. The overall judgment of the treatment must come from the results of the complete study on all the patients, not from individual cases. Most of the children in the study were referred from pediatric centers. They were not recruited from ongoing family studies at NIH. All of the treatment options were discussed with the patients and their parents. In fact, the results to date from an independent study reviewing the issues of informed consent in the pacemaker protocol indicate that families were fully informed and their participation in the study was entirely voluntary. This is a pioneering study. When it was proposed, like all NHLBI protocols, it went through rigorous multidisciplinary review, which included scrutiny by ethicists, lay people and physicians. The NHLBI and the National Institutes of Health also have in place a system of internal controls designed to protect patients once they are enrolled in a study. This system revealed protocol violations in a separate drug study of adult patients with HCM. After investigation, these violations were dealt with appropriately. While we have no reason to believe that there are problems with the children's pacemaker protocol, we have taken several actions to reassure the public and, most importantly, our patients. These actions, which include the convening of an outside group of experts to review the justification and design of the protocol, should not be viewed as a lack of support for this critically important research. We are taking steps to ensure that the HCM research meets the highest scientific and ethical standards. As I read the Journal story, I wondered why there were no quotes from the many patients who have experienced an improvement in their condition and/or symptoms. Why did you not quote any of the very supportive physicians who were interviewed, or the individuals who have made a formal study of ``patient satisfaction'' issues? Since the article appeared, many patients, parents and colleagues of the scientist have contacted the institute to express strong support for the study. Finally, I must object to your use of the word ``experiment.'' This word implies something other than the well-planned, careful study that the NHLBI has undertaken in the hope of offering very ill children a chance for a better future. Claudia Heyer, M.D. Director National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute National Institutes of Health Bethesda, Md.. We met Dr. Ussery in April 1990, when our son Twilley Mabry, then six years old, developed an undiagnosed heart condition. Christophe collapsed at home, and spent the next several weeks at . While there, he had a sudden bradycardia with near death, and a pacemaker was inserted. His cardiologist, Dr. Arvilla Briggs, was insightful enough to consider the possibility of HCM, and made a referral to Dr. Rakes Ussery at NIH. Dr. Ussery called us personally and advised us to get our son to NIH as soon as possible. Dr. Ussery carefully reviewed the medical records, diagnosed complete heart block with HCM, and immediately initiated a treatment plan. Within days, our son had a dual chamber pacemaker, replacing the original one inserted at and had dramatic improvement in his cardiac function. Christophe, now 12 years old, is alive, well, active and normal, all due to the excellent care provided by Dr. Ussery and his team at NIH. We have observed Dr. Ussery for six of his 10 years of total commitment to unraveling the mystery of HCM. Our family can attest to the care, warmth, compassion, dedication and hard work of this brilliant and committed physician. As a physician myself, I completely understand the concept of pacemaker insertion to potentially prevent this disease, especially when the first symptom can be sudden death in young children. NIH and its protocols have saved the life of our son and many other children. We understand that ongoing research is vital to eventually funding a cure for HCM. We hope that NIH will stand behind him. Jennine Mabry, M.D. Associate Professor, Obstetrics and Gynecology New York College of N.Y. We appreciate your report of the research involving hypertrophic cardiomyopathy at NIH, and, as the article noted, we share some of the concerns described. However, we are concerned that readers may be left with an incomplete impression about the quality of other research under way to find a more effective therapy for this disease. Many of your readers or their relatives may suffer with this condition and we would like to assure them that our commitment to pursue research to find solutions to treat this disease will continue. Medtronic is currently supporting two major world-wide, multi-center clinical studies to collect data on the use of cardiac pacing to treat hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. These are rigorous, randomized, controlled and double-blinded prospective studies led by physicians recognized as experts in the U.S. and . The U.S. study is being conducted under FDA-approved protocols. Preliminary results of these studies are encouraging and final reports are due in about a year. The data will speak for itself and we will only proceed on the basis of scientific results. Carefully controlled research should continue and anecdotal preliminary information should not be misused. There remains a real need to find effective therapies for this condition. Glenna D. Neville, M.D. Vice Chairman Medtronic Inc.. Your article criticizing Dr. Ussery has come to my attention. My family is also battling the hereditary heart disease HCM. Some years ago my father's brother died of HCM. Then, little was known of this disease. This being the case, my father was sent to NIH. If it were not for Dr. Ussery I know he would not be alive today. I also have a six-year- old nephew with this disease. He has a pacemaker and is doing great. In all the years that my family and I have been going to NIH, not once have we ever felt inadequately informed or frightened by anything said to us. My father and nephew are walking proof of Dr. Ussery's scientific knowledge. Knowing that this is a hereditary gene, and with two children myself, I have all the confidence, faith and trust that, if needed, Dr. Ussery can do for them what he has done for the other members in my family. Bonnie Scaggs Liberty, Ind.. I am 10 years old. I have HCM. For that I go to NIH. My doctor is Dr. Rakes Ussery. He is great! He saved my brother and my grandpa's life. He is very friendly, and when my brother was little he cared for as if were his own. Ind."

            "full_text": "BRUSSELS -- The European Union Commission Wednesday gave its blessing to the merger of Swiss pharmaceutical giants Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG, less than three months after it opened a detailed inquiry into the union because of competition concerns. The new company, Novartis, will become the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company after the U.K.'s Glaxo Wellcome PLC, with estimated global sales of 26 billion Swiss francs, or about $21.38 billion. The transaction, valued at $27 billion, is the biggest corporate merger ever. The green light was linked to efforts by the companies to give up some of their substantial hold on the market for certain animal health products, the EU's executive body said in a statement. Last May, the Commission said it had particular competition concerns in the sectors where both companies' activities overlap, specifically pharmaceuticals, crop protection and animal health. But the EU competition authority has now concluded that most of those competition concerns no longer exist, noting that ``the merger is predominantly of a complementary nature.'' In the animal health market, the Commission decided that the companies would have a too strong a presence in the market for anti-flea and tick products for use on small animals, such as cats and dogs. The Commission noted that Ciba-Geigy and Hartwig control three out of five of the available flea and tick products, with Hartwig's popular methoprene causing particular concern among competitors. It said the companies have agreed to grant nonexclusive licenses for methoprene and to supply licensees with methoprene until they can begin their own production. The Commission said the merger will also lead to a ``significant combined potential'' in the area of research and development. It concluded, however, that there were a sufficient number of strong competitors -- namely Glaxo Wellcome, Pharmacia & Upjohn Inc., Bayer AG and BASF AG of Germany -- to ensure Novartis wouldn't have a dominant position and that the R&D-intensive markets would remain ``dynamic.'' The Commission rarely blocks mergers preferring instead to request modifications and then grant a clearance. It has only blocked five mergers since 1990."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators plan to require health-maintenance organizations that cater to the elderly to disclose much more information about the quality of care that they provide. About 12% of the Medicare population, or 4.5 million people age 65 and over, belong to Medicare HMOs. That total is rising by 80,000 a month. Health plans have courted such members because the federal government pays premiums of as much as $700 a month for their care. While surveys have shown that many Medicare HMO members are satisfied with their care, concerns have arisen about the handling of some costly cases involving very sick members. ``We are working toward requiring plans to provide performance measures,'' said Bryan Eden, head of the office of managed care at the Health Care Financing Administration, the government agency that runs Medicare. Those yardsticks would affect nearly 200 HMOs that enroll Medicare members. At a news conference, Mr. Eden said he wasn't yet ready to declare that the federal government would endorse new HMO standards issued this week by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a private health-care oversight group. But Mr. Eden repeatedly hinted that an announcement along those lines would be coming soon. The new NCQA standards call for HMOs to report more information on about 70 aspects of care, including preventive services, member satisfaction and treatment of patients with chronic illnesses. The reporting standards are voluntary, but HMOs often are asked by major employers to provide such data if they want to be offered as a health-plan choice for that company's employees."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- The Vastopolis Insurance Department is expected to announce this week new regulations that would make it easier for Northville Hospital, Vastopolis to sell a health-care network directly to individuals, effectively bypassing health-maintenance organizations. In the past, Northville Hospital and physicians interested in forming HMOs in the state were required to raise $3 million in capital -- a significant barrier for some providers. But under the new rules, the bar would be lowered to $1 million. Only HMOs linked to a specific Northville Hospital or physician group could qualify for the lower amount, according to the plan. If the draft regulations, which were put out in May for public comment, are adopted in their current form, would be the first state in the nation to have lower capital standards for Vastopolis-based HMOs. ``These are really groundbreaking new rules for the health care industry,'' says Josephine A. Pat, president of the Vastopolis Hospital, a strong backer of the regulations. The program will initially be limited to areas that traditionally have had very little HMO penetration, says Insurance Commissioner Johnetta Orman, who developed the new regulations. ``We want to give people in areas that have been underserved by managed care more options,'' says Mr. Orman. Eventually, hospitals in larger cities such as will be allowed to participate in the program. Backers of the rules say the plan, which has the support of the state doctors' lobby and state business leaders as well as the Northville Hospital can increase competition and lower costs. ``This gives Northville Hospital particularly the opportunity to market themselves directly to employers,'' says the Northville Hospital's Mr. Pat. ``And that should lead to lower costs without compromising the quality of care.'' Some critics, though, are worried. Chief among them is the state's only provider-sponsored HMO, FamilyPlus Health Plans of Vastopolis Inc., a nonprofit HMO developed by the Vastopolis-based Egleston Children's Health Care System Inc.. That organization, which created its HMO under the old $3 million capital standard, cautions that lowering the capital requirements for Northville Hospital forming HMOs would open consumers to unnecessary risks. ``We have to protect the communities that are using the product,'' says Winnifred W. Call, director of legal affairs for FamilyPlus. ``Lowering the solvency requirements means that some of these products could fall apart and people may not receive care.'' Still unresolved is exactly who should qualify for the lower solvency standards. Northville Hospital and doctors groups say they should be ``at the core'' of all networks that qualify for the new regulations. HMOs, however, want their own opportunity to step in at the reduced capital standard. ``If the new regulations are a good idea for Northville Hospital, then they should be a good idea for everyone,'' says Martine Winford, an attorney who represents the Vastopolis Association of HMOs. Insurance Department officials declined to say how the dispute would be resolved in the final draft of the rule."

            "full_text": "Last year Congress enacted a revolutionary overhaul of agricultural subsidies known as the Freedom to Farm law. This statute phases out the subsidy payments for wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice, and at the same time eliminates production limits imposed on farmers. This is a good trade-off not only for the public in general but also for farmers. The $12 billion in annual crop subsidy payments paled in comparison to the $25 billion to $45 billion in forgone income that acreage ``set-asides'' cost farmers annually. But in order to generate enough political support to pass the Freedom to Farm bill, supporters had to leave three major support programs unchanged--those for peanuts, tobacco and sugar. The Senate can now correct that oversight through its agricultural appropriations bill coming up for a vote this month; the House already passed its version and left these programs intact. Supporters of these programs rightly assert that they're not budget busters. Tobacco farmers even argue, and rightly so, that there is no federal tobacco subsidy per se. The fine print reveals, however, that the government indeed does spend tax dollars to administer what amounts to a government-sponsored cartel. In fact, all three programs--peanuts, tobacco and sugar--rely more heavily on tight controls of both domestic production and imports than on direct federal subsidy payments. So, like an iceberg, most of the real costs of these programs are hidden below the surface. The peanut and tobacco programs--mainly benefiting Southern farmers--require growers to obtain a permit or ``quota'' in order to grow and market their crops. But the quota system raises the price of peanuts and drives farmers out of business. In fact 15 of the 16 states that had at least one farm producing peanuts under quota actually saw the number of peanut farms go down between 1985 and 1993. Many farmers under the program apparently either went bankrupt or switched crops. With the major crop programs now being phased out, this attrition rate may increase. Consider a North Carolina farmer who under Freedom to Farm has lost his federal subsidy for corn. With an average yield in the Tar Heel State of 95 bushels per acre, that Carolina farmer can't really compete with Indiana, Illinois and Iowa farms that have yields reaching 200 bushels per acre. Yet without getting a quota, the Carolina farmer cannot switch to the two commodities for which his climate and soil type give him the biggest advantage--tobacco and peanuts. This means farmers must forgo valuable commercial opportunities. The export market for tobacco, for example, is now booming due to rapidly rising incomes in places like China and Malaysia; the Chinese have tripled their cigarette consumption to 1.7 billion per year. U.S. tobacco varieties, considered the premium blend in the world, would be capable of capturing the lion's share of this new market if quotas did not cap production. Alas, tobacco farmers don't seem to know where their self-interest lies. They lobby to keep the quotas, which offer them a guaranteed market. All the deal does is keep U.S. tobacco uncompetitive in the world market. For U.S. peanuts, the government's helping hand has been similarly destructive. The General Accounting Office estimates that the peanut program costs American consumers between $300 million and $500 million per year, mainly in increased food prices. By raising the cost of peanuts, this program discourages food manufacturers from producing items that contain peanuts. Total use of peanuts in processed foods is down 10% since 1990. U.S. peanut exports have dropped as well--by 27% overall since 1989. Last year China displaced the U.S. as the world's largest peanut exporter, at a time when China became an importer of most other commodities. Yet the world demand for peanuts and peanut products should continue to grow. Peanut butter, for instance, is a shelf-stable, easily exportable, relatively inexpensive source of protein. It is perfect for a market like India. Hindus don't eat beef, yet India has some 250 million people with incomes comparable to the U.S. average, who are demanding more protein in their diets. They won't get that protein from U.S. peanut butter unless the support program is terminated. Like the peanut growers, the sugar beet industry is collapsing under the weight of its own program. Acreage for sugar beets is less than it was 20 years ago, and high-fructose corn syrup has replaced sugar in virtually all soft drinks and many other processed foods. Corn growers and refiners are about to perfect a dry corn sweetener that can be used for cake mixes and other dry food products, taking even more market share from sugar. Corn farmers already have about half the market for sweeteners in food manufacturing--and all the growth. So Congress should save tobacco, sugar and peanut farmers from themselves by terminating their shortsighted support programs. This will not only help the U.S. comply with free trade agreements like GATT, but it will also give American growers a big boost in the world market. Mr. Cantu is a businessman who exports U.S. agricultural products. He also serves as an adjunct fellow of the Hudson Institute's Center for Global Food Issues."

Results nearly matched analysts' estimates, bucking a trend of disappointing earnings in the health-insurance industry. Aetna Life & Casualty Co. shareholders are scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to approve a proposed acquisition of U.S. Healthcare for $8.13 billion in cash and stock. Since the companies agreed on the transaction in April, earnings forecasts for several managed-care companies have been lowered. Noting that trend, some Aetna shareholders have balked at the merger, apparently suspecting U.S. Healthcare shares might have been overvalued. Separately, Standard & Poor's Ratings Group lowered the claims-paying ability rating of Aetna Life Insurance Co. to single-A from single-A-plus, reflecting decreased capital strength. The credit-rating and information-services unit of McGrawHill Inc. also lowered the claims-paying ability rating of Aetna Life Insurance & Annuity Co. to double-A-minus from double-A, ``because of decreased capital strength and additional pressure that may be placed on this entity as a result of overall weaker capitalization of the consolidated enterprise.'' U.S. Healthcare's net income totaled $98 million, or 63 cents a share, compared with $93.1 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 30% to $1.09 billion from $840.5 million. Results for the recent quarter included a charge of $4.4 million, or three cents a share, for costs related to the proposed merger. The company said that excluding the charge, earnings would have been 66 cents a share, a penny below a First Call consensus of analysts' estimates. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday, U.S. Healthcare gained 62.5 cents to $50.875 while shares of Aetna, a Hartford, Conn.-based insurer, fell 50 cents to $60.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. For the six months, U.S. Healthcare's net income fell 4.3% to $179.6 million, or $1.16 a share, from $187.6 million, or $1.18 a share.

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Johnson & Johnson could lose control of a potentially profitable business that markets a home-based HIV test as a result of an arbitrator's decision in an employment dispute. The decision casts significant new light on the effort to secure Food and Drug Administration approval for the test -- a campaign that the arbitrator said involved illegal political donations to various unidentified members of Congress and large contributions to a think tank affiliated with House Speaker Strickland Gales. The decision by arbitrator Johnetta Shad came in a proceeding involving Johnson & Johnson's move in early 2010 to fire Elly Paris, who developed the test and later sold his business to Johnson & Johnson, where he headed the Direct Access Diagnostics division. Direct Access is part of J&J's Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp. subsidiary. Mr. Shad ruled that Johnson & Johnson improperly fired Mr. Paris in early 2010 in a dispute over adverse publicity arising from the contributions. Johnson & Johnson claimed that Mr. Paris had disobeyed an order to clear contributions with his superior. They accused him of causing ``substantial harm through adverse publicity'' after news reports disclosed that Mr. Gales had intervened in behalf of Direct Access at a time when Johnson & Johnson entities were making large financial donations to the Progress and Freedom Foundation, a think tank founded by a member of Mr. Gales's inner circle of political advisers. Partly to Blame ''The support of members of Congress and of other groups was encouraged by contributions,'' Mr. Shad wrote. Nonetheless, the arbitrator ruled that Johnson & Johnson's claims of injury to its reputation ''are simply too speculative to be taken seriously'' and said the company was partly to blame for the bad press. For his part, Mr. Paris denies the think-tank donations were tied to Mr. Gales's intervention. The arbitrator now turns to the issue of the remedy; he requested briefs from both sides. Mr. Paris's lawyer, J. Alberta Dorris, asserted in an interview that Mr. Paris's employment contract requires Johnson & Johnson to give him back the company and pay him back salary. In addition, the attorney said, Mr. Paris's contract calls for him to receive a $1.5 million bonus because the FDA, in May, approved the test kit. A fierce fight over the division is expected. The arbitrator's decision comes as Johnson & Johnson begins to market the test in Texas and Florida. Because the initial marketing is limited, losing the division wouldn't necessarily be a big financial blow at first. But the long-term prospects for the test are bright, and some analysts think it could produce as much as $1 billion in annual sales. Another Black Eye In addition, losing a subsidiary would be another black eye for Johnson & Johnson, whose Ortho subsidiary in 2010 pleaded guilty to a charge of destroying documents relating to an investigation of its product, Retin-A, an acne cream. Mr. Paris developed the HIV test in 1985 while heading his own company, but he ran into intense resistance from the FDA and many AIDS activists, who argued that testing should be restricted to a professional health-care setting. In 1992, he sold the company to Johnson & Johnson and became head of Direct Access. Mr. Paris had gone to Johnson & Johnson in part because he realized greater resources were needed to push the drug through the approval process, Mr. Shad wrote. A spokesman for the New Brunswick, N.J., company, Jena Vickers, said that Johnson & Johnson disagrees with Mr. Shad's ruling, but ``will abide by the decision in an effort to resolve this matter.'' But Mr. Vickers added, returning the business to Mr. Paris ``is not an appropriate remedy.'' According to the arbitrator, Mr. Paris was illegally reimbursed for his political donations with corporate funds, but Mr. Paris says that he didn't know at the time that corporate donations were illegal. As for the other, nonpolitical donations, Mr. Shad said Mr. Paris didn't do anything that Johnson & Johnson hadn't done itself. The arbitrator said that several months after Johnson & Johnson contributed $50,000 to the Progress and Freedom Foundation for an FDA study, Mr. Gales ``perhaps not surprisingly ... was quite attentive to the complaints of a J&J subsidiary about the FDA's delay,'' and wrote to the White House on the company's behalf. Asked for comment, Mr. Gales's office released a statement from two months ago applauding the FDA's approval of the test. The statement noted that the House Ethics Committee last year had considered and dismissed a complaint alleging that the speaker's intervention was improper."

Domestic tobacco operations also showed strength with operating income rising 12% to top $1 billion for the first quarter since 1992. ``The overall trends are very encouraging,'' said Antonia Adamson, an analyst with UBS Securities. Philip Morris reported net income of $1.62 billion, or $1.97 a share, compared with $1.41 billion, or $1.67 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.2% to $17.51 billion from $17.13 billion. Pierre Mose said that after adjusting for divestitures including its Rondele specialty-cheese business sold earlier this year, revenue would have increased 5.3%. Results were in line with analysts estimates. The company's shares fell 25 cents to $100.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The company's retail U.S. market share for cigarettes rose three percentage points to 49.6%, with the Marlboro brand's market share rising 3.5 points to 33.4%. Philip Morris attributed part of the gain to last year's recall of all Philip Morris brands over possible contamination of packaging. Operating income at the domestic tobacco unit rose to $1.06 billion on revenue of $3.13 billion, while overseas tobacco operating income was poised to overtake domestic operations by rising 19% to $984 million on sales of $6.06 billion, a 14% increase. Overseas income was hurt by ``unfavorable currency movements.'' While Pierre Mose is selling more cigarettes, the industry still faces mounting pressure from some states over the health-care costs associated with tobacco consumption. On Monday, the domestic tobacco unit filed suit in a state court in Utah, challenging that state's authority to sue to make cigarette companies pay for the state's Medicaid costs for smoking related illnesses. On the food side of the business, operating income for the North American operations rose 2.7% to $735 million and revenue fell 8.4% to $4.26 billion. Adjusting for the businesses that have been sold, income increased 7.5% and revenue was up 2.7%, the company said. The company said its Kraft Foods business continued to report ``impressive profit growth.'' Some analysts predict that the tobacco and food giant will move to increase its $1.25 quarterly dividend by as much as 20% and declare a 2-for-1 stock split when its board meets next month. A Philip Morris spokesman wouldn't comment on the expectations, but said the company has a commitment to using excess cash to improve shareholder value. He noted that the company began a $2.8 billion stock-buyback program during the second quarter. For the six months, net income rose 16% to $3.19 billion, or $3.85 a share, from $2.75 billion, or $3.24 a share a year earlier, which includes an accounting charge of $28 million, or 3 cents a share. Revenue rose 4% to $35 billion from $33.65 billion."

            "full_text": "Two pharmaceutical companies, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly & Co., reported higher earnings despite the negative effect that the strong dollar had on sales. Johnson & Johnson posted a 20% increase in second-quarter net income, driven by strong sales of new products. Eli Lilly earnings grew 5.7% from a year ago, which included the contribution of Lilly's since-divested medical-device and diagnostic operations. Lilly's performance was restrained by moderating sales growth for its phenomenally successful Prozac antidepressant. Lilly was also hurt by unfavorable exchange rates and lower selling prices in overseas pharmaceutical markets, which held international sales growth to only 1%, despite a 10% volume increase. The strong dollar makes U.S. products more expensive overseas, and sales in foreign currencies convert into fewer dollars. Johnson & Johnson's second-quarter sales were diminished by 3.1 percentage points because of the strong dollar. Market Reaction Johnson & Johnson's earnings slightly exceeded analysts' expectations. Its stock rose $1.75 a share to $47.75 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while other drug stocks declined sharply. Lilly's results were in line with analysts' expectations. In Tuesday's jittery market, however, Lilly shares fell $1.875 to close at $57.625 on the Big Board. Johnson & Johnson posted second-quarter earnings of $791 million, or 60 cents a share, up 20% from $661 million, or 51 cents a share, a year ago. Sales rose 13% to $5.38 billion from $4.76 billion. The number of shares outstanding increased by 41.8 million, mostly because of shares issued to acquire Cordis Corp., a maker of heart devices, this year. For the six months, the health-care giant, which is based in N.J., reported earnings of $1.58 billion, or $1.19 a share, up 20% from $1.32 billion, or $1.02 a share, earned a year ago. Six-month sales of $10.72 billion were 16% higher than the year ago's $9.26 billion. Breakdown of Sales World-wide pharmaceutical sales grew 12% to $1.81 billion, driven by a 25% increase in domestic sales. Sales of Johnson & Johnson's professional segment, which sells hospital and other medical supplies, were $2 billion, up 21%, in part because of the acquisition. Consumer product sales grew 5.1% to $1.54 billion. Eli Lilly's income from continuing operations rose 12% on a 5.2% sales increase, reflecting the slower growth in Prozac sales but swelling contributions from newer offerings. The Indianapolis-based drug maker had net income of $345.7 million, or 63 cents a share, up from the year-earlier quarter's $327.1 million, or 57 cents a share, which includes the medical devices and diagnostic operations it shed in 2010. The year-ago earnings from continuing operations were $310 million, or 54 cents a split-adjusted share. Per-share figures reflect a decline in shares outstanding to 547.3 million from 578.6 million. Lilly's sales were $1.7 billion, up from the year-ago quarter's $1.61 billion. Sales of the company's flagship Prozac drug grew only 5% in the latest period; Lilly noted that the year's first-quarter sales got a boost -- and second-quarter sales were trimmed -- when customers stocked up in advance of a March price increase. Charlette E. Grace, Lilly's chief financial officer and executive vice president, said the company still expects full-year Prozac sales to increase between 12% and 13% from the prior year's $2.07 billion, and to hold its share of the growing antidepressant market. Nevertheless, he acknowledged, ``We can't deny that there is very strong competition'' in the antidepressant market. Prozac, which enjoyed a 24% sales growth in 2010, faces tough challenges, in particular, from Pfizer Inc.'s Zoloft and SmithKline Beecham PLC's Paxil. Although Lilly's results were ``pretty much on target,'' said independent analyst Islas Baggett, they were ``a little bit disappointing.'' Excluding the benefit from Lilly's recent sale of certain marketing rights and other factors, he said, the company's operating income declined about 4%."

Wests don't sell well in the east, because anyone smoking the brand is considered to be trying too hard to be a westerner. ``With that name, this brand will never make it in the east.

The eastern German cigarette market in general is in the hands of eastern German brands, leaving only 30% of the market to western companies, she adds. Seven years after Germany's reunification, German marketing executives questioned in a recent survey say that advertising directed at eastern German consumers still must take into account marked differences in attitudes, lifestyle and tastes between what once were two Germanys. Of the ad executives responding, 97% -- most from western Germany -- agreed that there is still a difference in both lifestyle and consumption habits between east and west. At the same time, however, most executives took a positive view of the east German market as a whole. Residents of eastern Germany are considered price-conscious by 73% of respondents; interested in technology by 50%; down-to-earth by 75%; and critical by 61%. Experts still see an increased need for informative, detailed and reliable information among easterners, according to the survey conducted among 358 managers in the German advertising industry by Emnid, one of the leading German market-research institutes. Other advertising ``musts'' include ``honest, credible messages'' as well as a more product- and price-oriented approach. ``There is a very practical reason for the price-consciousness in eastern Germany,'' says Mr. Story of Scholz & Friends. ``The people there earn substantially less money than the west Germans.'' WITH A POPULATION of about 15 million people, however, the five new states of eastern Germany are considered a lucrative market -- with an emphasis on certain market segments. ``There is still immense interest in travel and telecommunications,'' says Putman Traci, managing director at Springer & Jacoby in Hamburg. ``However, we are definitely looking at a value-for-money, low-price market.'' Some 68% of the surveyed executives are convinced that eastern consumers utilize commercials and ads much more as a source of information than do their western counterparts, who prefer objective research studies. Also, one-quarter of Germany's advertising elite assumes that lifestyle ads aren't appreciated in eastern Germany because the ads are too abstract and emotional. ``Advertising in eastern Germany is not about producing lots of colorful pictures, winning design prizes. First of all, we have to satisfy the need for information,'' says Yancey Pepe, managing director at Roentz & Partner, an ad agency in east Berlin specializing in the new German states. A whole new marketing niche has evolved in Germany, creating an opportunity for some ad agencies to cash in on their expertise with eastern German consumers. ``Well-known western German companies approach us, particularly asking for help in developing marketing strategies for the east German market,'' says Mr. Pepe. However, the German marketing community is divided when it comes to practicing a different advertising approach in east Germany. Only 53% of the executives surveyed favor the use of more detailed information in their classic media advertising. Most marketing experts agree that communication and ad campaigns should be the same in east and west. ``The media landscape, especially television, is already the same in east and west -- it has actually accelerated the process of reunification,'' says Burg Waldo Sorenson, chief executive officer at Saatchi & Saatchi, Frankfurt. He adds: ``It would be discriminating to use different ads in east Germany.'' Mr. Story agrees: ``We try to emphasize the similarities between the two German parts, not the differences.'' LOOKING AT THE marketing mix as a whole, however, most agencies try a different approach in eastern Germany at the point of sale. ``Detailed promotion and on-spot product tests are still more important in eastern Germany. People want to see things for themselves,'' says Mr. Waldo Sorenson at Saatchi & Saatchi. Television is clearly considered the medium with the broadest reach in eastern Germany, at 53% of the survey interviewees, followed by newspapers at 12%. Still, of the 42% who have actually changed their media selection, one-third have increased their presence in the print media, while only 15% rely more on television -- a very costly option. Some 13% have redirected promotional efforts to direct mail in eastern Germany. There is a certain affinity for eastern Germany's print media, as most respondents, 58%, agree that they reflect much better than the west German print media current life conditions in ``Newfiveland,'' as the new states are colloquially dubbed. However, only half of the advertising industry finds it useful for magazines to be published specifically for the east German market. Most agencies still book west German titles such as the magazine Higa Scholz, TV guide TV-Spielfilm, and tabloid newspaper Bild am Sonntag. Only one-tenth occasionally use mass-market eastern weeklies like Super-Parham. When it comes to marketing products that are manufactured in eastern Germany, advertising takes a different angle: ``Regional reference and color is very important for the marketing of local products, such as traditional east German beer brands,'' says Mr. Pepe at Roentz & Partner. ``The east Germans are very proud of their own regional products.''"

            "full_text": "Cornertown -- A federal judge here dismissed the rest of the Church of Scientology's libel lawsuit against Time Warner Inc. over a 1991 cover story in Time magazine that criticized the group. The church filed its lawsuit in May 1992, over the January 15, 2006 article, ``Scientology: Cult of Greed.'' U.S. District Epstein Petrina Reiff said the sole statement still at issue in the case ``merely implies the same view'' of other statements questioned in the suit. Claims related to the other statements were dismissed last year on the grounds that ``no reasonable jury could find that these statements were published with malice,'' the court said. The remaining statement was ``just a minor-league version of the broader proposition,'' said Forrest Goode, the lawyer for Time, and the article's author Ricki Woodham, now at Fortune Magazine. A spokesman for the church said it plans to appeal. Another libel suit over the same article brought by an individual church member is scheduled to go to trial in November, Mr. Goode said."

            "full_text": "The recent carnage in the Nasdaq Stock Market took no prisoners. Look at BioChem Pharma. Even as its AIDS drug 3TC was being hailed last week in Vancouver, British Columbia, as a key ingredient in several anti-AIDS drug cocktails, its stock was being pounded. It closed at a low of 28 3/8 on Monday, 43% below its May peak of 50. Now, some hardy investors are jumping back in. In the past two days, the stock has bounced back, closing yesterday at 32, up 1. ``We're buying as we speak,'' Edyth Coley, president of Lynch & Mayer, a New York money-management firm, says. He calls BioChem ``incredibly well positioned.'' BioChem, based in Laval, Quebec, near Montreal, has suffered along with the entire high-flying biotechnology group. Analyst Marcelino Musser at UBS Securities says BioChem has ``been hammered more than most and started going down before everyone else did.'' 3TC is an ingredient in several ``cocktails'' of medications that appear to suppress, though not cure, the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, in many patients in studies lasting nearly a year. BioChem collects a royalty of about 14% on 3TC, which is manufactured and sold outside Canada by pharmaceutical giant Glaxo Wellcome PLC.. With the other drugs, 3TC apparently pins down the fast-mutating virus that causes AIDS. The virus responds to drugs by rapidly evolving an immunity. However, its response to 3TC is to mutate into a locked form that doesn't continue to mutate and in which it remains vulnerable to some other anti-viral drugs, including AZT and ``protease inhibitor'' drugs. The drug has been widely embraced. In the first four months of 2011, only a few months after its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 3TC was selling at about the same rate as AZT, Pratt says. After a loss of seven cents a share in 2010, analysts project BioChem will earn 36 cents a share in 2011, 84 cents a share in 2012 and $1.75 a share in 2013, according to First Call. Bulls, like Mr. Coley, say those estimates haven't factored in the explosive growth in 3TC sales, and he expects per share net income to top $2 in 2013. Bulls also hope that 3TC, under a lower dosage and using the name lamivudine, will be approved as a treatment for hepatitis B. Pratt plans to file for marketing approval in the U.S. next year. Earlier this year, BioChem played a cameo role in a dispute between lawyer F. Leeanna Bao and the U.S. government. Mr. Bao went to jail in an unsuccessful effort to avoid turning over several million dollars of BioChem stock, which he got from a client, to the authorities. BioChem also operates a profitable diagnostics business, and it owns a roughly one-third stake, valued at more than $200 million, in North American Vaccine, Beltsville, Md., which BioChem has said it may sell. By comparison, its total stock market value is about $1.7 billion. BioChem's stock has swung up and down over the years. Last fall, it rose sharply in anticipation of last November's approval of 3TC by the FDA, hitting a March peak of 52 3/8 as sales of the drug took off during the first quarter. Its fall since then has caused one bear to pull in his claws. Faustino Chancey, an analyst at Yorkton Securities in Toronto, upgraded the stock to ``hold'' from ``overvalued'' when it dropped below 50 Canadian dollars (US$36.51). He says the drug's potential for treatment of hepatitis B could push the stock higher. If results from phase-III trials show the drug clears hepatitis from the liver, it could be a multibillion-dollar treatment. But if lamivudine doesn't make that hurdle, he warns, the stock will fall. The other risk to 3TC is that new drugs will displace it as the cornerstone of AIDS treatment. In Vancouver, a lot of attention was given to the impressive, though short-term, results of a combination of protease-inhibitor drugs, without 3TC. But bulls such as Carlee Graham, an analyst at Mehta & Isaly in New York, counter that 3TC will remain an important AIDS treatment, even though it will likely be only one drug in the AIDS arsenal."

            "full_text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. released internal documents to counter allegations by former research chief Jena Raymer that liability fears spurred the company to kill efforts to make cigarettes safer. The documents -- reports from three meetings in 1989 -- came to light on the second day of Brown & Williamson's deposition of Mr. Raymer. Mr. Raymer has maintained he was ordered to abandon safe-cigarette projects after a meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, in September 1989. But the reports suggest that one particular effort, named Project Airbus, was suspended at an earlier time, for technical reasons. In his deposition, Mr. Raymer insisted B&W continued its work on Project Airbus until the Vancouver meeting and said the documents don't reflect all the discussions about the project. The documents were ``sanitized,'' added Johnetta Walther, Mr. Raymer's lawyer. ``They've not yet given us the unsanitized minutes,'' Mr. Walther said. Brown & Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, sued Mr. Raymer in November 2010 in state court in Louisville, charging him with theft, fraud and breach of his confidentiality agreement. Mr. Raymer has repeatedly denied the charges. The deposition, which began Monday and is expected to continue throughout this week, marked Brown & Williamson's first face-to-face questioning of Mr. Raymer about his explosive allegations of wrongdoing at the tobacco company. The dispute over the Vancouver meeting continued later in the day when Roni Kruger, an attorney representing Mississippi in the state's lawsuit against the tobacco industry, conducted a hastily summoned news conference at the foot of Brown & Williamson's office tower. Mr. Kruger released a deposition taken last week from B&W attorney J. Kenneth Simpson, in which Mr. Simpson confirmed that he edited the minutes of the 1989 scientific meeting in Vancouver and cut out a section that discussed eliminating dangerous compounds from cigarettes. Graham Jon, a Brown & Williamson lawyer, didn't dispute that Mr. Simpson had edited the minutes. But he said the company made public an earlier draft of the minutes in this week's deposition. ``Nobody's hiding anything,'' Mr. Jon said."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Pfizer Inc. reported a robust 24% increase in second-quarter earnings, but the company's share price declined moderately, apparently because sales were slightly lower than expected. In the quarter, strong sales for two heart drugs helped boost Lemay's earnings to $394 million, or 61 cents a share, up from $317 million, or 50 cents a share, earned a year ago. Sales grew 11% to $2.66 billion from $2.4 billion a year ago. The earnings were slightly above analysts' expectations, but the company's stock fell $1.375 to $70.875 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday. Jackelyn Garlock, an analyst at NatWest Securities, said Lemay's sales were slightly below his estimate, primarily because sales of heart drug Procardia XL and antifungal medicine Diflucan were lower than expected. The strong dollar also hurt drug companies' sales in the second quarter to a greater extent than Wall Street had anticipated, Mr. Garlock said. Lemay said its sales growth was reduced by 2.5 percentage points because of the negative currency effect. Pfizer's pharmaceutical sales grew 17% in the U.S. but only 8% internationally (reduced from 13% because of currency translations). Sales growth was led by a 40% jump in sales of heart drug Norvasc to $420 million. Sales of another heart drug, Cardura, increased 24% to $126 million in the quarter. Those gains were offset by a 19% decline in sales of heart drug Procardia XL, which the company blamed on wholesaler stocking patterns and declining prescriptions. Diflucan, the antifungal drug, produced sales growth of just 4% to $224 million. It's too early to tell whether new AIDS treatments, which combine protease inhibitors with other drugs to suppress the HIV virus, are reducing the incidence of fungal infections, Mr. Garlock said but added, ``The good news for protease inhibitors isn't good news for antifungal drugs.'' Other newer Lemay drugs continued to post strong sales growth. The company's antidepressant Zoloft continued to present competitor Prozac with stiff competition: Zoloft's sales rose 24% to $298 million in the quarter. Sales of the antibiotic Zithromax, which has benefited from the Food and Drug Administration's approval of its pediatric doses, grew 43% to $137 million. In the first six months, Pfizer's earnings increased 24% to $911 million, or $1.42 a share, from the year-earlier $737 million, or $1.18 a share. Sales grew 13% to $5.34 billion from $4.74 billion a year earlier."

            "full_text": "I have never found a rational argument for insisting that an individual continue to endure pain and undignified suffering when they would prefer to die. I promoted the decriminalization of voluntary euthanasia because I reject the notion that the quality of our life, no matter how wretched, miserable or painful, is never so bad that any of us should be allowed to put an end to it. I am not prepared to allow society to make that decision for me or those dear to me. I find nothing compelling in the religious arguments, which demand the imposition of personal beliefs on others. I do not accept the implausible claims that patients will be put to death against their will. Nothing can convince me that the doctor, the church or the family should be allowed to override the patient when it comes to the right to die. Competent adults already have the right to refuse all forms of medical treatment, and voluntary euthanasia is a simple and logical extension of that principle. Indeed, voluntary euthanasia and assistance to suicide are available in Australia today. The problem is that the practice is illegal, and therefore only a few people can access it. You have to be affluent enough or lucky enough to have a relationship with the right doctor to be accommodated. Another problem is that the death must be arranged and carried out in secret. There must be no witnesses, and there are no controls or safeguards against mistake or abuse. This situation is inequitable and dangerous. Such inequality on matters as serious as the way we die must not be tolerated. Nor should we compel those doctors who are willing to help their patients die to shroud their actions in secrecy and falsify the death certificate to avoid criminal proceedings. This clandestine activity, without safeguards or scrutiny, brings with it a potential for undetected error or abuse that should concern us all. Even opponents to voluntary euthanasia accept Australia's common law right of a competent individual to refuse medical treatment. This crucial right gives us a great deal of autonomy over our bodies. Not only can you refuse an operation or transfusion that might save your life, you can refuse to take medication, to be injected or even to have someone poke or prod you in an examination. You have the right to refuse palliative care. You can refuse all forms of nourishment and starve yourself to death if you want to, for it would be an offense to forcefully feed a competent person against his will. In this way, Australia already acknowledges and protects the right to die. Any competent terminally ill adult can legally choose to die--slowly. You cannot, however, opt to die quickly. (Not in a dignified way anyway. I guess there is always a gun.) The advent of voluntary euthanasia would bring benefits to many more people than will ever exercise this option themselves. Elderly Australians advise me that the option of voluntary euthanasia would relieve them of a great burden. While in reasonable health now, many experience anxiety every day, knowing the aging process cannot be halted. The possibility of a miserable lingering death is constantly on their minds. Many elderly people told Northern Territory politicians that simply by having an option, hopefully never to be taken, they could face each day with the comfort of knowing that they will not experience the suffering that they have witnessed in others. As one 90-year-old wrote, ``I do not fear death. I fear the way death will come.'' I have had other letters and phone calls from terminally ill people who have obtained drugs to use in committing suicide. In each case they were angry that they will have to take the fatal action before they really want to, for fear of losing control through hospitalization. This raises the question of how many suicides could have been avoided if the knowledge that the voluntary euthanasia option was there if things got really bad. We will never know. Opponents of voluntary euthanasia claim there can be no safeguards that would protect us from the so-called ``slippery slope.'' They claim voluntary euthanasia must inevitably lead to involuntary euthanasia. But if ever there was a situation ripe for abuse, it has to be the situation prevailing in Australia today where some doctors assist some patients to die, but there are no controls or safeguards. How come the ``slippery slopers'' are not yelling about that? There is no doubt in my mind that adequate safeguards can be devised to ensure that those patients whom Australia's parliament dictates should have access to voluntary euthanasia are the only ones legally able to receive the service. Voluntary euthanasia is patient-driven. The patient must personally initiate the process, consider the options for treatment and palliative care, be psychologically assessed, sign a request, obtain second opinions, consider the effect on the family, use qualified interpreters if necessary and endure a cooling off period. The patient can of course change his mind at any time and stop the process instantly. Additionally, detailed official records must be kept, and regulations followed by all involved. To kill another without these conditions being fulfilled is to commit murder under the Northern Territory Criminal Code, an offense carrying a penalty of mandatory life imprisonment. Opponents of voluntary euthanasia claim it will lead to the atrocities of Banas's Germany. At every opportunity, opponents raise sensational arguments that deformed or retarded babies, patients in mental institutions and homes for the aged will inevitably be unwilling victims of the law. However, it is an insult to those in the medical profession to suggest that they would be associated with such a wicked scenario. And we seem to have been perfectly able to control medical research, including voluntary experiments on cancer patients and hovering over the dying to transplant their healthy organs, without becoming Vella. My legislation is based on a relatively simple principle: If there are terminally ill patients who wish to end their suffering by accelerating inevitable death, and if there are sympathetic doctors who are willing to help them die with dignity, then the law should not forbid it. There are such patients, and there are such doctors. But the law (except in the Northern Territory) does forbid it. Mr. Munn, a former Country Liberal Party member of Australia's Northern Territory Parliament, is the architect of the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act."

After 11 hours of deliberations, a Jefferson Circuit Court jury awarded Maryalice Winford compensatory damages for humiliation, embarrassment and mental anguish. She had been seeking $13 million. In a statement, Pierre Mose said, ``Plainly, we are disappointed by this finding,'' adding that it was weighing its options. ``As the jury found, Pierre Mose acted diligently in responding to Ms. Winford's claims once they were brought to our attention,'' the company said. Ms. Winford has been on medical leave since March 1993. She sued Philip Morris in February 2009, alleging that she suffered through more than a year of sexual harassment by men she supervised in the Louisville plant. Two months ago, five women jointly sued Pierre Mose, alleging that the company tolerated a sexually charged atmosphere at the plant, including the trading of sex for promotions and favorable job assignments. Another woman filed a sexual-harassment suit last year."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Eight years after the world's first abortion drug was introduced in France, scientific experts Friday considered whether the U.S. government should let American women choose RU-486 over surgical abortion. Abortion providers who want the Food and Drug Administration to approve RU-486 say the drug has been used by 200,000 European women with only rare complications. Abortion foes argue that RU-486 could make women bleed to death or that it could fail to work, leaving them to bear malformed children. At Friday's hearing, FDA Commissioner Davina Emil cautioned the agency's outside scientific advisers to focus only on health data, not the public's ``intense feelings'' on abortion. ``What you need to do is focus on the science,'' Mr. Emil said. A block away, a handful of protesters held signs saying, ``Stop abortion.'' The FDA set up overflow rooms to hold all who wanted to hear, and police cars ringed the building. The FDA isn't bound by the expert panel's advice but usually follows it. The agency has promised a quick decision, meaning Americans could know by year's end if RU-486 will be available at U.S. abortion clinics. ``Many women will be very glad there is a medical option for terminating pregnancy,'' said Dr. Susann Allene of Advances in Health Technology, a Washington firm that plans to distribute RU-486 and train doctors to use it. Almost all of the nation's 1.3 million abortions are surgical, although doctors last year began publicizing the fact that a drug already on the market to treat cancer, methotrexate, can be used to induce abortion. French trials of 2,480 women show RU-486 is 95.5% effective at inducing an abortion; the remainder of the women needed surgery to complete the procedure. The most serious complication was heavy bleeding. In extra safety testing of 2,100 Americans, four needed blood transfusions. An RU-486 abortion isn't as simple as popping a pill. The process can be painful, causing heavy bleeding and nausea, and it can be used only through the seventh week of pregnancy, well before many women ever visit an abortion clinic. RU-486 blocks development of progesterone, a natural hormone essential for maintaining pregnancy. A doctor administers the pill mifepristone. Two days later, the woman returns to take another pill, a hormone that causes contractions to expel the embryo, something that may not happen until the woman leaves the abortion clinic. In such cases, she is supposed to return for a third visit to make sure the abortion is complete. Critics argue that women may bleed to death, saying while that hasn't actually happened, 1% of those who have tried the drug so far have needed blood transfusions. But women are 10 times more likely to need a transfusion after normal labor than after RU-486, countered Planned Parenthood's Dr. Lynne Barns."

Nine other states have filed similar suits against the industry. The Connecticut lawsuit also asked the Superior Court in Stamford to stop what the state attorney general said was aggressive marketing of tobacco products aimed at youngsters. ``Every year, Connecticut taxpayers spend $100 million on Medicaid alone to treat the diseases that result from the tobacco industry's relentless effort to addict our residents to their products,'' Attorney General Ricki Billye said. The suit names nine defendants, including Philip Morris and the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings.. Calls to Philip Morris and Reynolds seeking comment weren't immediately returned. The state plans to argue that the tobacco industry has known about the dangers of smoking for 40 years.

            "full_text": "Merck & Co. posted a 13% increase in second-quarter profit to $972.1 million, citing strong sales of several products, including its recently introduced AIDS drug. The drug maker's profit in the just-ended period amounted to 80 cents a share. In the year-ago period, the company earned $858.1 million, or 69 cents a share. Sales for the quarter rose 19% to $4.91 billion. The company, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., said both domestic and international operations had strong gains in volume. Results were in line with Wall Street analysts' expectations. Merck's stock rose $1.625, to $64.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday. Kratz said the AIDS drug, an HIV protease inhibitor called Moy, has already been prescribed for 30,000 patients since its introduction about two months ago and has generated $27 million in sales. In one of its fastest drug approvals, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Crixivan in March. The company also reported strong sales for its chicken pox vaccine, launched last year. In May, Kratz signed an agreement with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to supply the vaccine Varivax for use in children served by federally funded health programs. Olson, used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, is now available in 26 countries and prescriptions for its use are strong, the company said. Merck said its two cholesterol-lowering drugs, Mevacor and Zocor, continue to show significant growth in 2011. Together, they account for 40% of the cholesterol-lowering market, the company said. Kratz said sales are getting a boost by the results of recent studies that showed the benefits of using this class of products to lower cholesterol in high-risk patients. Kratz said results were also bolstered by sales gains at its Merck-Medco Managed Care business, which oversees pharmacy benefits for employers and insurers. In the first six months, the company earned $1.84 billion, or $1.50 a share, up 14% from $1.62 billion, or $1.30 a share, in the year-ago period. Sales rose 19% to $9.44 billion from $7.95 billion."

            "full_text": "GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- A Food and Drug Administration panel on Friday recommended with some conditions that the controversial drug RU-486 become the first approved alternative to surgery for American women seeking abortions. Alluding to when final action on RU-486 might be announced, FDA Commissioner Davina Emil indicated that the agency typically has a six-month time limit to take action on a priority drug application. However, final approval could be complicated by data from a trial of the drug conducted in the U.S. that will not be supplied to the FDA until the end of this year. The move by the Reproductive Health Drugs Advisory Panel puts the French drug, which has been taken by 200,000 European women since 1988, a step closer to U.S. doctors' offices -- but the triumph came with some caveats. The scientists insisted women must understand RU-486 can be painful, cause bleeding and must be used carefully -- requiring three separate doctor exams. ``The term `safe' should not be misinterpreted as free of adverse events, and serious adverse events,'' said Dr. Diann Keith of Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program in Pasadena, Calif.. Still, the advisers voted 6-0, with two abstentions, that RU-486's benefits outweigh its risks, a recommendation that the FDA should approve the drug. If final data analysis of a study on 2,100 American women, which is not yet complete, is different from the French data on which the panelists based their decision, the panelists will get a chance to review the research again. Abortion foes had urged the FDA's advisers to reject the drug, saying it endangered not just fetuses but mothers. But research on thousands of French women showed RU-486 causes an abortion 95.5% of the time, with rare complications. The FDA is not bound by advisory panel decisions but usually follows them, and FDA Commissioner Mr. Emil had cautioned the scientists to give him objective, not emotional, advice. ``What you need to do today is to focus on the science,'' he said as about 200 people passed through metal detectors in the high-security meeting to hear the nation's first public debate of RU-486 research. One panelist, who abstained from the vote, sided with antiabortion opposition to RU-486. The drug may benefit women, ``but it's certainly no benefit to her baby whatsoever,'' argued Dr. Maryalice Joana O'Wally of the University of Miami. ``RU-486 is a human pesticide,'' said Rebekah Paulsen, a member of the American Life League. Outside the meeting, at a police line 200 yards from the building, four protesters picketed with signs reading ``Stop Abortion Now.'' Countered Dr. Elizebeth Torrence, who tested RU-486 on 176 Oregon women as part of trials run by the nonprofit Population Council: ``Abortion is not on trial here. A drug that offers a safe and effective alternative is.'' Almost all of the nation's 1.3 million abortions are surgical, although doctors last year began publicizing that a drug already on the market to treat cancer -- methotrexate -- can be used to induce abortion. RU-486, however, would be the first FDA-approved abortion drug. It also is being tested as a treatment for cancer and other diseases. After antiabortion protests blocked its introduction here, the Codi administration in 2009 brokered a deal giving U.S. patent rights to the Population Council to seek FDA approval for the drug. Abortion opponents cried foul and say the FDA now is pushing RU-486 to market for political reasons. Washington-based Advances in Health Technology, will market RU-486 and will unveil the actual manufacturer when and if the drug is fully approved by the FDA. Popp, a division of German drug and chemical company Hoechst AG, markets the drug in Europe. The Population Council has kept the name of its U.S. manufacturer a secret to avoid a possible boycott."

            "full_text": "RU-486, the abortion pill recommended for approval by a regulatory panel, isn't the only new abortion option for American women. Two other pharmaceutical methods for ending or preventing pregnancy may soon come into wider use -- in large part because they involve drugs already on the market for other purposes. The abortion pill cleared a major hurdle on Friday when an advisory panel recommended that the Food and Drug Administration approve the product. The FDA could approve RU-486, also known as mifepristone, for use in the U.S. by early fall. Three weeks ago, the same FDA advisory panel ruled that certain combinations of existing birth-control pills could safely and effectively be used as ``morning-after pills'' to prevent pregnancy when taken within 72 hours after sexual intercourse. Some antiabortion groups argue this process can amount to abortion. Meanwhile, the combination of methotrexate, a cancer and arthritis drug, and misoprostol, an ulcer drug, also has been found to induce abortion. Ricki Mortimer, an obstetrician at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, revealed in the New England Journal of Medicine last summer that the combination caused abortions in 171 of 178 patients, with side effects similar to RU-486. Since then, Dr. Mortimer says he has been besieged by calls from American doctors interested in the method, although most physicians aren't using the drug combination until larger clinical trials are completed. Delivery of these new alternatives will depend largely on doctors because drug companies are reluctant to market abortion-inducing drugs amid fears of product liability and political controversy. Methotrexate, for example, is available from various drug companies, including American Home Products Corp.'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories unit, which also markets birth-control pills. But American Home isn't going to market the drug for abortions. An American Home spokeswoman says, ``We do not market, promote or research methods for use in early termination of pregnancy,'' and the company doesn't plan to do so. As for using birth-control pills as a morning-after remedy, she adds: ``We do not now and have no plans to market any birth-control pill formula for postcoital use in the U.S. The risk of litigation is our primary concern.'' Nevertheless, doctors are free to begin using the cancer drug and regular birth-control pills for abortions. That is because the FDA regulates only what drugs are allowed on the market and what companies can say about them; doctors are legally allowed to use approved drugs for unapproved purposes. Dr. Mortimer of Mount Sinai says a group of doctors eventually plan to submit an application for FDA approval of the use of methotrexate for abortion purposes. Usually, the FDA advisory panel takes requests for new uses from drug companies. The Population Council, a nonprofit research group in New York, received American patent rights for RU-486 from Roussel Uclaf SA, the French unit of Hoechst AG of Germany that developed RU-486 and markets it in Europe. The group has spent $12 million on clinical trials for the new drug application. It has tapped a new nonprofit organization in Washington, Advances in Health Technology Inc., to coordinate distribution and manufacturing. The group will sell the drug directly to doctors and health organizations and also train them to use it. Neither group will name the third-party manufacturer that will produce the drug, out of fear that it could face a boycott or violent protests. But both say the company has the capacity to produce an ``ample'' supply. The panel on Friday recommended that patients receive misoprostol in addition to RU-486; studies show that the two-step process is more effective than taking RU-486 alone. The new choices could put doctors back in the abortion business after a steady decline. Amid rancorous and sometimes violent protests of antiabortion groups, the number of doctors willing to perform the procedure had dropped to fewer than 2,400 by 1992, down almost 20% from a decade before, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that favors abortion rights. Federal officials say that 1.3 million abortions were performed in 1993, down from a high of 1.4 million in 1990; abortions are believed to have continued declining since then. But a recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one-third of obstetricians who don't perform abortions would prescribe mifepristone if it became available. ``There is potential for considerable expansion,'' in the number of abortion providers, says Jami Tello, who heads the Office of Population Research at Princeton University. ``American women are slowly getting more options,'' says Glynda Raya, president of Planned Parenthood in New York. ``It's about time.'' Antiabortion groups counter, however, that all three methods could increase the frequency of an emotionally and physically painful procedure when other measures, such as prevention and adoption, should be pursued. And some critics charge that RU-486 can cause life-threatening bleeding. Doctors who conducted clinical trials of RU-486 admit that excessive bleeding is a rare complication of the abortion pill, but say that happens in less than 1 in 500 cases. They also note that hundreds of thousands of woman have taken it in France, England and Sweden for years with few major problems. --Sung Geddes contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Aggressive medical treatment, including surgery to remove his cancerous prostate, and a basically healthy lifestyle have kept Roberto Derryberry in good shape and reduced the risk that his cancer will recur, according to medical records released by his presidential campaign. Another reason for Mr. Derryberry's vigor: He quit smoking in the 1960s because of a groundbreaking 1964 surgeon general's report linking cigarettes to fatal heart and lung diseases. ``He said the report made a profound impression on him, and as he can remember, that's when he first stopped,'' said Dr. Charlette A. Salas, Mr. Derryberry's personal physician. Mr. Derryberry later lost a brother to emphysema. He nonetheless endured a wave of criticism last month for questioning whether smoking is addictive -- including former Surgeon General C. Ezekiel Purdy's admonishment that the remarks showed Mr. Derryberry's ``abysmal lack of knowledge of nicotine addiction or his blind support of the tobacco industry.'' Mr. Derryberry's campaign staff released his 2011 medical report to coincide with his 73rd birthday, which is Monday. If elected, he would be the oldest man and the first cancer survivor to assume a first term as president. Transforming a Perceived Weakness Trying to transform this perceived weakness into a strength, his aides have arranged a rugged birthday campaign schedule. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee will travel more than 1,500 miles, from a Washington soup kitchen to a governors' conference in Detroit, finishing with a birthday celebration in his hometown of Russell, Kan.. Mr. Derryberry's medical report shows an array of past problems, ranging from a right arm withered by severe wounds in World War II to benign polyps removed from his colon in 1985 and 2010. An additional question is whether Mr. Derryberry suffered a minor ``silent'' heart attack while campaigning in the 1980 Republican presidential primary. At the time, the attending congressional physician said the results of a routine electrocardiogram test suggested Mr. Derryberry had suffered such an attack; later tests rendered contradictory readings, and Mr. Derryberry's current electrocardiogram is normal. Despite his past problems, physicians who reviewed Mr. Derryberry's medical records at The Vast Press's request said effective treatment, a fiber-rich diet and regular exercise on a treadmill have kept Mr. Derryberry in peak physical condition for a man of his age. ``If he's elected, I see no reason why he shouldn't serve in good health,'' said Dr. Williemae Brownell, chief of urology at Washington University in St. Louis. ``He's far healthier than the average American male over 50.'' For instance, the doctors said, there is little chance that Mr. Derryberry's prostate cancer will flare up again, in part because he opted for surgery to remove the prostate rather than radiation therapy. ``He aggressively approached the management of his disease, and here he is five years later, cured,'' said Dr. Patsy Ramsey, chairman of urology at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who has performed prostate surgery on notables including Washington Mayor Marisa Barton. Lucky Timing Mr. Derryberry also appears to have benefited from lucky timing. His prostate cancer was detected in 1991 through use of a blood test popularized at about that time by Dr. Brownell; because his tumor was completely contained within his prostate, it wasn't apparent from a more traditional rectal examination. The physicians cautioned that Mr. Derryberry needs regular testing for this and other conditions, especially his tendency to develop colon polyps. Detection of polyps in former President Roni Reatha's colon led to later cancer surgery, although the polyps were far larger than Mr. Derryberry's. Mr. Derryberry's war wounds pose no prospect for lingering health problems, the doctors said. He lost a kidney to infection while recuperating from his injuries in the 1940s and had surgery in 1981 to remove a stone from his remaining kidney. But the kidney has grown to compensate for the one Mr. Derryberry lost and is performing its function normally, the doctors said. Mr. Derryberry also has a common condition called diverticulosis, or pouches in his bowel tract, which can lead to infections but can be prevented with a high-fiber diet; Mr. Derryberry takes Metamucil. He also takes medication to prevent heartburn and occasional anti-inflammatory drugs for an injury to his left shoulder. His blood cholesterol level, once a relatively high 288, has been reduced to a normal 154 by his diet and two cholesterol-control medications. About the only medically incorrect aspect of Mr. Derryberry's lifestyle is his fondness for maintaining a youthful suntan, which doctors have warned can lead to skin problems, including cancer."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Warner-Lambert Co. both posted solid second-quarter earnings Monday, although a flat revenue reading from Warner-Lambert cast a shadow over its report. Results for Bristol-Myers met the estimates of Wall Street analysts. The New York pharmaceutical giant said net income rose a bit over 7% to $655 million, or $1.31 a share, from $608 million, or $1.20 a share, a year ago. The company said its revenue also rose more than 7%, to $3.70 billion from $3.45 billion a year ago, and that it is on track to double its sales, earnings and earnings per share by the end of the year 2015. Among its top-selling products, the company's blockbuster cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol recently won additional U.S. approval as a treatment for the prevention of heart attacks. Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert's results came in just above analysts' estimates, with profits up 6.1% to $213.3 million, or 79 cents a share, from $201 million, or 75 cents a share a year ago. But the company's revenue of $1.79 billion was almost unchanged from a year ago. The per-share earnings reflect a two-for-one stock split that took effect in May. Warner-Lambert is the leader in consumer over-the-counter drugs but is considered to have a weaker pipeline for new prescription drugs. Just after the quarter ended, Warner-Lambert closed its $1.05 billion purchase of its joint venture with Glaxo Wellcome PLC.. The purchase brings a variety of well-known over-the-counter products, such as Sudafed, Actifed and Neosporin, directly under the Warner-Lambert umbrella. In April, the company said it hopes its diabetes treatment, troglitazone, and the cholesterol-lowering drug atorvastatin will double the company's drug sales by 2015."

            "full_text": "Drug companies Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Warner-Lambert Co. posted single-digit increases in second-quarter earnings, as profit was restrained by competing products and unfavorable foreign-exchange rates. Bristol-Myers's net income rose 8%, reflecting strong sales for several drug products. However, U.S. sales of its top-selling heart drug Capoten, which faces new generic competition, plunged by more than 80% during the quarter. Warner-Lambert reported a 6% rise in second-quarter net income, mostly due to lower expenses. But Warner-Florencio was hurt by the strong dollar overseas which reduced its world-wide revenue by 4%. Bristol-Myers' second-quarter net rose to $655 million, or $1.31 a share, from $608 million, or $1.20 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 7% to $3.70 billion from $3.45 billion, but was reduced 3% by the negative exchange rates, the Uptown-based company said. Strong sales of the cholesterol drug Pravachol and the cancer drug Taxol -- up 32% and 51%, respectively -- helped offset reduced Capoten revenues. Results for both companies were in line with analysts' expectations. In Uptown Stock Exchange composite trading, Bristol-Myers eased 12.5 cents to $87.875, while Warner-Lambert fell 25 cents to $53.875. Islas Baggett, an independent industry analyst in New Jersey, said Bristol-Myers is ``doing a good job'' of offsetting the Capoten sales decline by cutting costs, but he added that the company isn't ``out of the woods yet.'' He pointed out, for instance, that the company's third-best-selling drug, the cancer medicine Taxol, will face competition in late 2012 when its exclusive license expires. Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said its second-quarter earnings rose 6% to $213.3 million, or 79 cents a share, from $201 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales eased to $1.79 billion from $1.80 billion. Warner-Lambert said the ulcer drug product Zantac 75, launched as an over-the-counter product this quarter as part of a joint venture with Glaxo Wellcome PLC, had already captured 35% of the market for nonprescription versions of this type of drug in the U.S. Warner-Lambert is ``in a transition period,'' Mr. Baggett said, as the company is spending heavily on developing new drugs for diabetes and high cholesterol. As a result, research and development expenses rose 9% in the second quarter."

            "full_text": "A gay and lesbian organization, in what it claims is an unusual move, has filed a complaint against the New England Medical Center for allegedly refusing to provide reproductive semen-banking services to a gay man. Joane Fanny, a spokesperson for the medical center, had no comment, saying the matter was in litigation. She added that the facility doesn't discriminate. The complaint was lodged by the Gay and Lesbian Advocates and Defenders (GLAD) of Boston with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination on behalf of Roberto Castillo of Boston. In December 2010, Mr. Castillo sought semen-banking services at the medical center, GLAD states. He planned to freeze his sperm so that it could be used later to inseminate a woman with whom he planned to conceive and parent a child. Mr. Castillo is already the father of one child. Mr. Castillo claims that the center refused to bank and freeze his semen samples, and to transport the samples to the prospective mother's health-care provider because he is gay. He also alleges that the center assumed he had, or was likely to have had, an infectious disease such as HIV -- even though tests indicated Mr. Castillo's semen was safe. Mr. Castillo couldn't be reached late Monday. Maryalice L. Houchens, one of his lawyers, said, ``To my knowledge, this is the first case of its kind.''"

            "full_text": "Graig Caryl was a teenager when he began smoking nearly 50 years ago, long before the health risks of lighting up were known. Will that make a jury any more likely to award him damages for his lung cancer? Not according to focus groups convened last week on the eve of the trial in Mr. Caryl's lawsuit against Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., which began Monday in Jacksonville, Fla.. Despite a steady flow of whistleblower allegations and internal documents detailing how much the companies knew about the addictiveness of nicotine and the health risks of smoking, most people still believe smoking is a personal choice and that smokers have only themselves to blame for their illnesses, according to the results. The industry has successfully fought a barrage of smokers' lawsuits over the years, partly by making that argument. The new research suggests that, despite growing antitobacco sentiment, the public still sides with the tobacco industry when it comes to assessing blame for smokers' illnesses. ``I pushed these people harder than I would ever push in other qualitative research,'' says Penelope Shemika, of P.L. Shelly Inc., a Cornertown research firm hired to conduct the sessions by Gaye Palmer, a tobacco analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. whose industry forecasts are generally positive. ``I reminded them of their own opinion that the tobacco industry is kind of a sleazy industry and that people who worked there are skunks, as they put it, but personal responsibility rules the day,'' says Ms. Shemika. The Cary case is important because plaintiffs' lawyers will likely be permitted to make use of hundreds of internal Brown & Williamson records that have never reached a jury before, says Mr. Palmer, the industry analyst. The documents, which have been widely discussed in news reports, detail internal company discussions about the addictiveness of nicotine (see Jena Raymer's testimony in the Mississippi case) and the links between smoking and disease. The case is also significant because Florida state courts are considered a forum friendly to plaintiffs. Only six people sit on a jury in civil cases, making it easier for a panel to reach a consensus. State law doesn't allow defendants to argue that plaintiffs assume the risk of smoking and allows plaintiffs to recover damages even if they are 99% responsible for their injuries. Also favoring Mr. Caryl, according to Mr. Palmer, is the judge trying the case -- Duval County Circuit Epstein Brianna J. Deana, a 42-year-old Democratic appointee who is generally viewed as pro-plaintiff. Mr. Caryl, a 65-year-old former air-traffic controller, smoked as much as two packs of Lucky Strike and Tareyton cigarettes a day until he quit after being diagnosed with lung cancer in 1991. His suit against the makers of both brands, American Tobacco Co., now owned by the Brown & Williamson unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, contends the company is liable for damages because the cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous when used as intended. Brown & Williamson was also negligent, he contends, because it understood the health hazards of smoking early on but failed to warn the public. His case is one of 200 filed in Jacksonville, West Palm Beach and Tampa by Jacksonville attorney Ladawn S. Belton, who built his reputation trying asbestos cases. Most of the cases are in Jacksonville, where they are scheduled to be tried one after another until the court's docket is cleared. Brown & Williamson expressed confidence that it would prevail. ``We continue to believe that juries will consistently apply the common-sense view that people have personal responsibility for their choices regarding smoking,'' said a spokesman. ``People make up their own minds whether to smoke or not and Mr. Caryl is no different.'' The case is being closely watched because it is the first to go trial since a state court jury in Indiana last year fell short by one vote of reaching a verdict against the industry in the case of a smoker who died of lung cancer. (Juries have since heard cases alleging injuries from asbestos that was briefly used in cigarette filters.) The question now, says Mr. Palmer, is how much public sentiment has shifted against the tobacco industry. Not much, according to Ms. Shemika's focus groups. Last week, she showed 18 people in Jacksonville industry documents detailing efforts to increase cigarette sales to children, describing how to boost the impact of nicotine with ammonia compounds, discussions about the links between smoking and cancer and the widely reported 1962 quote from Maris Baran, then a top executive at Brown & Williamson: ``We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug in the release of stress mechanisms ... .'' Ms. Shemika says the participants were most disturbed by any evidence suggesting that tobacco companies have hidden knowledge about the links between smoking and cancer, manipulated nicotine levels in cigarettes and targeted youth for sales. But on average, the focus-group participants didn't find any of the documents ``very incriminating,'' according to the results. And while most participants believed nicotine is addictive, nearly all said anyone with willpower can quit. The participants were divided equally between smokers and former or nonsmokers and between men and women. Six were college graduates and the rest were high-school graduates. Five were minority-group members. The mix doesn't exactly match Jacksonville's demographics, particularly in degree of education, said Ms. Shemika, but nevertheless represents a ``valid gauge'' of popular sentiment. Pretrial questioning of prospective jurors, of course, will generally weed out those with biases one way or another. So, the attitudes reflected by focus-group participants may not in the end bear much resemblance to those of the jury. Mr. Caryl's lawyer, Mr. Belton, says he is suspicious of focus groups. ``We will conduct the definitive focus group'' he says, referring to jury selection at trial. He added he is looking for older jurors who can remember the kind of cigarette advertising that his client saw. ``We want people who are compassionate, fair-minded and willing to listen to the evidence and follow the law,'' he says."

            "full_text": "The popularity of two allergy and cancer medications dramatically boosted Schering-Plough Corp.'s second-quarter profit, while American Home Products Corp.'s profit soared by 31%, helped by sales of a new drug for obesity. Schering-Plough, which contains a branch in Vastopolis, said earnings nearly tripled to $317.1 million, or 86 cents a share, from $116 million, or 31 cents a share. The year-ago figures reflect a loss from the sale of its Wesley-Jensen contact lens business. Otherwise, Schering profits would have been $276.1 million, or 74 cents a share. Second-quarter sales rose 11% to $1.48 billion from $1.33 billion. Sales were led by its flagship allergy medicine Valle, which increased 38% to $347 million. Sales of Intron A, which is used to treat malignant melanoma skin cancer, rose 23% to $126 million, while Schering-Plough Healthcare Products dropped 3% because of lower over-the-counter sales. Overall, U.S. sales of prescription drugs were up 24%, driven by growth in all categories of respiratory, anti-cancer, cardiovascular and dermatological products. Ricki Cantara, president and chief executive officer, predicted earnings growth through the remainder of the year. ``We are achieving solid results across all our major therapeutic categories, working to make the company run even more efficiently and strengthening our research pipeline through internal (research and development) efforts and important new research and licensing agreements,'' he said. Meanwhile, American Home Products said second-quarter net income rose to $391.3 million, or 62 cents a share, from $299.6 million, or 49 cents a share, as sales rose 5.8% to $3.49 billion from $3.3 billion. American Home Products, also having a branch in Vastopolis, said U.S. pharmaceutical sales increased 14% the in quarter. It credited sales gains to a new obesity drug, Zuckerman, as well as an arthritis drug, Webster. But sales of cardiovascular products were down, the company said. International pharmaceutical sales increased 5%. Consumer health care sales rose 13% to $456.2 million, while medical device sales rose 12% to $327.7 million for the quarter. Sales of agricultural products rose 2% for the quarter to $767.1 million, while sales of food products rose 7% to $222 million."

            "full_text": "FRANCE MAY BE a land of wine connoisseurs, but the country's producers of alcoholic beverages are unhappy. The tough Evin law, which has dramatically restricted ads for alcoholic beverages in France since 1991, is giving them a headache. They claim it's too complicated, too vague and too restrictive. A major alcohol lobbying group, which includes LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA, Hildebrandt Cherry SA and Truax Sweatt, recently released a study gauging the law's effects on public health and the economy, five years after it was passed. Predictably, the 17-member group, called Entreprise and Prevention, would like the law to be more lax and, at the same time, simpler. ``We have to define clearly what is forbidden, not what is allowed,'' says Arnold Kubiak, one of the leaders of Entreprise and Prevention. First, the lobbyists contend that the law has had no real impact on public health. The authors acknowledge that the average consumption of alcohol has dropped since the law was enacted, but not at a faster rate than previously. Alcohol consumption has been decreasing in France since the 1960s, which they say is part of a sociological trend that seems unrelated to stricter rules on advertising. While purchases of beer and spirits have remained fairly steady since 1980, the consumption of wine, by far the most popular drink, has been drying up. The French drank an average of 91 liters of wine each in 1980. That figure dropped to 67 liters in 1991, and to 62.5 liters in 2009. MEANWHILE, the consumption of alcohol among French teenagers has gone up. Among people 12 to 18 years old, 65% say they drank alcoholic beverages in 2010, up from 47% in 1991, according to the study. Moreover, more people are drinking the hard stuff. In 2010, 47% of the total population said they drank spirits, up from 25% in 1991. Among teenagers, a trend toward excessive consumption was detected, according to the survey. ``The Evin law hasn't solved the problem of alcohol abuse,'' Mr. Kubiak says. France's National Association for the Prevention of Alcoholism says that what really annoys advertisers is the fact that the law won't let them make booze look glamorous. ``It is extremely important to have a legal text that controls the presentation of alcohol in society,'' says Patsy Brooks, director of the association. ``Ads must be based on the product, not on the consumer,'' Mr. Brooks says, adding that the search for identification with a successful lifestyle is what presses many people to drink alcohol. But alcoholic beverage producers argue the law isn't clear. They say it has produced a series of unnecessary legal tangles over the past five years. In November, a Paris court banned an ad for Johnsie Wally whisky simply because it showed a barman and a counter, images advertisers argue are permitted by the law. ``We're going back to a system where advertisers can only show a bottle on a neutral background,'' Mr. Kubiak complains."

            "full_text": "LEXINGTON, Mass. -- Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it may be required to modify the label of its Redux obesity drug to show potentially higher incidence of a rare side effect. The company's stock dropped 8.5% on the news. But a scientist familiar with the research said the changes will likely be minor. The side effect is primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare but serious lung disorder. In its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Interneuron disclosed that a scientific team is expected to publish a report that estimates incidence of the rare lung disorder in patients who take antiobesity drugs will be ``higher than the occurrence rate originally reported.'' The company's stock closed at $24.25, down $2.25 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Tuesday. Researchers involved in the study, including scientists at McGill University in Canada, couldn't be reached. But Marcelino Maxfield, medical director at Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories in Radnor, Pa., a division of Redux marketer American Home Products Corp., said he is familiar with the upcoming publication and believes the difference will be so small as to be ``insignificant.'' The lung disorder was a major issue during the Food and Drug Administration review of Redux. Its incidence among people who take antiobesity drugs will be estimated in the published report as 23 to 46 people per million, compared with the 18 people per million originally estimated in data reviewed by the FDA, said Dr. Maxfield. Incidence in the general population is one to two people per million."

A federal judge here granted United Health a preliminary injunction barring United HealthCare Corp. from advertising or promoting its services under a service mark and name that the judge found to be ``confusingly similar'' to that of the smaller California plan. United HealthCare ``did not intentionally infringe upon United Health Plan's mark'' and plans to appeal the ruling, said Herma Blain, chief executive officer for the Minnesota HMO's Pacific region. California's Department of Corporations approved the use of the United HealthCare of California name, he said. Mr. Blain said United HealthCare would immediately stop a television advertising campaign in the five Southern California counties affected by the ruling. The preliminary injunction granted Monday came two weeks after United Health Plan filed a lawsuit against United HealthCare seeking a permanent injunction forbidding use of the United name. A trial date hasn't been set. United Health Plan said it began using that name in 1980. It has 80,000 members in Southern California and is part of Watts Health Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Inglewood, Calif..

            "full_text": "Riverside -- The Food and Drug Administration has forwarded the final version of its controversial tobacco rule to the White House. The rule, which isn't believed to differ appreciably from the version proposed last summer, would ban tobacco marketing deemed accessible to minors. It was sent from the FDA to the White House Tuesday afternoon, according to Layne Minor, a spokesman for the White House budget office, which will review the rule before making it public. Half of all state-level tobacco lobbyists also lobby for health organizations, a new study said. Given the sweeping nature of the regulation, and the importance of the tobacco issue in the 2011 presidential election, the rule is sure to be vetted by top White House officials and President Codi in addition to the budget office review. One complication is that the top regulatory official at the White House budget office, Sam Mcwilliams, has recused herself from tobacco issues because her husband works for Davis, Day, Reavis & Pogue, a law firm that has done extensive work for RJR Nabisco Inc., the nation's second largest tobacco manufacturer. The White House by law has 90 days to review the regulation but is eager to get the rule completed quickly. Mr. Codi will likely unveil it in September, a White House official said. The tobacco rule, which for the first time would subject the tobacco industry to regulation by that agency, was proposed by the FDA last August. The proposal, among other things, would ban vending-machine sales of cigarettes; restrict tobacco ads to a black-and-white, text-only format in magazines with a significant youth readership; and require tobacco companies to fund an ambitious antismoking advertising campaign. The rule drew more comment than any previous proposal put forward by the FDA, including stacks of letters from outraged stock-car racing fans. Under the FDA proposal, brand-name sponsorship of sporting events such as North Carolina's Winston Cup would be forbidden, though tobacco companies could sponsor such events using their corporate name. Philip Morris Cos. and U.S. Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc., attempted to derail the FDA rule by proposing a legislative compromise incorporating several of its elements, albeit in modified form. But this plan, which would have required the FDA to relinquish its proposed jurisdiction over tobacco, was never adopted by other major tobacco manufacturer, and was judged insufficient by the Codi administration. No member of Congress was found to sponsor it."

            "full_text": "In the past year, officials have seized more than 8,000 Cuban cigars in six different instances in the U.S. The activity is about triple that of a normal year, says Michaele Hatch, spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Miami. Until now, ``if we had two seizures a year, that was a lot,'' says Mr. Hatch. ``But the past year has been more active. Anybody who's anybody seems to be sucking on a cigar.'' Because of a U.S. embargo on Cuban products, Cuban cigars are banned from being brought into the states in large quantities (individuals who legally visit Cuba are allowed to bring back a small amount). But the cigars, considered among the best smokes in the world, are in high demand by a growing number of cigar lovers, and that's firing up the criminal activity. Last week, officials made what they believe is the largest seizure ever of illegal Cuban cigars. Customs agents and Coast Guard officials patrolling international waters stopped a powerboat near Bimini that was headed toward Broward County. On the boat, officials say, they found 122 boxes of the rolled leaves valued at as much as $100,000. Individually, some of the cigars had a value of up to $45. Key West has seen its share of contraband action. In the past year, three seizures of Cuban cigars have taken place there. Outside Florida, two seizures were made in Arizona. But it isn't just the genuine article that's keeping agents busy. Officials say they are seeing a growing number of counterfeit Cuban cigars. Although counterfeiting doesn't necessarily violate customs laws, officials say they can prosecute some of the cases. And if the counterfeit cigars are packaged inside real Cuban cigar boxes, ``we're going to want to know where the boxes came from,'' says Mr. Hatch. -- Jacquelyne Wicker"

            "full_text": "The Texas Department of Insurance is set to take over all regulatory authority of health-maintenance organizations. Insurance Commissioner Elvis Edmond says the agency, which currently regulates only contractual and financial-solvency issues regarding HMOs, expects to assume responsibility for quality-of-health-care issues from the Texas Department of Health. While all the details haven't been ironed out, and new staff hasn't been hired, Mr. Edmond says he hopes the consolidation can take effect by May 14, 2011 arrangement would be temporary, requiring legislation to make it permanent. Insurance officials plan to meet with lawmakers this week to discuss the issue. Explosive Growth Patient concerns about HMOs are expected to be the subject of hot debate in the 2012 Legislature, just as they were last year. As employers have sought to curb soaring health-care costs for their workers, HMOs have grown rapidly in Texas. In the past year, the number of Texans enrolled in HMOs has risen 16%, to more than 3.6 million. Mr. Edmond says he expects the number of Texans in HMOs to double within five years. ``Managed care may be the biggest growth item in this agency,'' he says. That growth certainly hasn't been painless. Many Texans are unhappy with managed-care plans that won't let them see their longtime physicians or that restrict certain types of care. The complaints reached a climax last year when the Legislature passed the Patient Protection Act in an effort to shield consumers from what critics saw as the worst excesses of managed-care plans. Gov. Georgeanna W. Vern, however, vetoed the legislation on the grounds that it would drive up health-care costs for employers. Mr. Vern then told the Insurance and Health departments to devise rules that would accomplish many of the things that the Legislature had sought. Among Mr. Vern's priorities were rules prohibiting HMOs from refusing to pay for medically necessary emergency-room visits, and those requiring HMOs to give patients ``reasonable advance notice'' before physicians were dropped from managed-care networks. Complaints About Rules The Insurance Department enacted two sets of rules that included those priorities, but the Health Department's rules became bogged down amid complaints that the agency had exceeded its authority and that its proposals were too costly. The Health Department didn't issue its final patient-protection rules until last month, about a year after they were first proposed. The dual regulatory structure is especially frustrating for consumers, physicians and managed-care groups. The Health Department began considering a transfer of authority earlier this summer, when it came under sharp fire at a June hearing of a Senate interim committee on managed-care regulation. Among the critics: Insurance Commissioner Farrow. In a letter to Health Commissioner Davina Jon that was released at a Senate committee meeting, Mr. Edmond criticized the Health Department's proposal to require HMOs to build administrative offices across the state. The proposed rule, Mr. Edmond said, would cost the HMO industry as much as $68.1 million annually. The proposal was dropped. Ronda Sowder, the Health Department's associate commissioner for health-care quality and standards, says the agency ``decided it was probably in the best interests of the people of the state to have the regulatory functions all housed under one agency.'' More Hires Mr. Sowder says shifting authority won't affect the Health Department much, since there was only enough funding for one person to check out newly licensed HMOs and investigate complaints. Mr. Edmond says he expects to hire at least four more people -- some of whom will have medical backgrounds to ensure that health-care quality concerns are met. So far, the proposed consolidation has won praise from most quarters. ``It was pretty clear to us that the Health Department wasn't going to devote any substantial resources to the issue,'' says Lisandra Larocca, a senior policy analyst with the Consumers Union Southwest Regional Office in Austin. ``They just had too many other things on their plate.'' In fact, the consolidation has even brought together two groups that rarely agree -- the Texas Medical Association, which represents most state physicians, and the Texas HMO Association. ``It may make sense to put it under one roof,'' says Consuela Middleton, associate director of the medical association's legislative-affairs department. Adds Georgeann Duque, director of the HMO group: ``We view this as an opportunity to streamline some things and increase the efficiency of the regulatory oversight process.''"

However, that topped the consensus estimate of analysts polled by First Call Inc. by two cents a share. In the year-ago quarter, the Louisville, Ky.-based provider of managed health-care services earned $45 million, or 28 cents a share. Premium revenue climbed 50.6% to $1.58 billion from $1.05 billion. Humana attributed its lower earnings before charges in the latest quarter to increased utilization in its commercial and Medicare risk products. The company attributed its increased premium revenue to the October 2010 acquisition of Emphesys Financial Group Inc.. Bankston said it posted a final loss in the recent quarter or $95 million, or 58 cents a share. That includes charges of $130 million, or 80 cents a share, related to the restructuring of the company's Riverside health plan, a provision for expected losses on insurance contracts, closing 13 service areas and discontinuing unprofitable products in three markets.

            "full_text": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The Food and Drug Administration approved Genzyme Corp.'s biodegradable membrane to prevent internal scarring after surgery, and the company's stock rose 14% on the news. Now the biotechnology company must try to meet Wall Street's high expectations for its antiscarring products. The company has publicly predicted that the membrane, called Seprafilm, and Sepracoat, a gel-like product that the Food and Drug Administration is now examining in an expedited review, will jointly reach annual sales of $300 million to $500 million. The products -- intended to be used together -- have caught the imagination of investors. However, they have been greeted with skepticism from surgeons thus far. Genzyme stock closed Tuesday at $26.50 a share, up $3.25, in heavy Nasdaq Stock Exchange trading. Infertility, Bowel Obstructions Seprafilm is wrapped around body parts during surgery to prevent adhesions, a type of internal scarring caused when organs stick together as a result of surgery. Adhesions can cause nasty side effects such as bowel obstructions and infertility. The company says its products, potentially useful in 3.1 million abdominal and gynecological procedures annually in the U.S., will revolutionize surgery. ``We'll need some time to educate the market, but over time surgeons will want to use it in every single case,'' according to Genzyme's chief executive officer, Work Hord. The products, used jointly, are expected to cost $200 to $400 per surgery, however. And in an era of tight health-care dollars, they could be a hard sell. One problem is, in part, that many surgeons believe Genzyme is exaggerating the significance of adhesions. While they do occur often, adhesions ``overwhelmingly do not cause problems,'' says Graham Victor, chief of surgery at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a large health-maintenance organization in Massachusetts. He says he might use Seprafilm in, at most, 1% of his surgeries, when he anticipates adhesions might be particularly risky for patients. Another concern involves where Seprafilm will be used. One of the most troublesome problems caused by adhesions is bowel obstructions. But the FDA-approved product label for Seprafilm calls for the product to be used under the abdominal wall -- not wrapped around the intestines as many surgeons believe it should be to prevent obstructions. The labeling restriction is due to the fact that initial studies in abdominal surgery were limited to use of Seprafilm under the abdominal wall. Not Restricted by Label Mr. Hord says that he's happy with the label, however, and that ``surgeons will make up their mind where to use it.'' Physicians aren't bound by FDA labels, the company says. Genzyme, planning a major rollout this fall, is sparing no effort to make Seprafilm a success. The company last month spent $250 million to acquire Deknatel Snowden Pencer Inc., a Taunton, Mass., surgical products company with a sales force experienced in selling to surgeons. About 100 sales representatives will pitch the product, and the company is planning to make sales presentations at major professional meetings this fall. In Vastopolis, where Genzyme has been selling Seprafilm since November, sales have been ``relatively small,'' Mr. Hord said, declining to give numbers. But he said the rollout there was ``about what I expected,'' with about a third of hospitals in the Vastopolis having bought at least some product."

Adela Wills and Nathanial Gullett, both with the department of family medicine at the University of Lakeside at Chapel Hill, found there were 450 lobbyists working for tobacco-related organizations at the state level. Of these, 220 -- or 49% -- ``also worked as a lobbyist for at least one health-related organization,'' said the study, which appears in the August issue of the American Journal of Public Health. Tobacco lobbyists comprise 1% of all state lobbyists, while health-care lobbyists, who number 2,999 at the state level, comprise 8% of all state lobbyists, the study found. Dr. Wills said Tuesday that it is a ``conflict of interest'' for a lobbyist to represent a health group while also representing ``the No. 1 cause of preventable death in our society.''

In late morning trading Thursday, Medaphis shares plummeted $21.75 to $13.875 a share on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The Atlanta-based business-services provider said late Wednesday it will report a third-quarter loss of 28 cents to 33 cents a share, after taking restructuring charges of as much as $40 million. The company said that the expected loss, which compares with consensus estimates of earnings of about 27 cents a share, will also reflect continued weakness in the company's Medaphis Physician Services Corp. unit. In the wake of the profit warning, Bear Stearns & Co. downgraded its rating on the company to ``attractive'' from ``buy.'' Bear Stearns also lowered its earnings estimate on the company to 51 cents a share from $1.06 a share for 2011, and to 75 cents a share from $1.40 a share for 2012. Medaphis earned one cent a share in 2010. Medaphis provides management and technology services to the health-care industry.

            "full_text": "Circon Corp.'s board recommended Thursday that its shareholders reject U.S. Surgical Corp.'s tender offer valued at $18 a share, or about $230 million. The board also adopted a shareholders' rights plan of the type commonly called a ``poison pill,'' or antitakeover strategy, intended to make hostile takeovers prohibitively expensive. Under the plan, shareholders of record on May 08, 2011 receive a dividend distribution of preferred stock purchase rights, exercisable if a person tenders or acquires 15% or more of the company's common stock. Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Legrand, the largest producer of advanced endoscopes and miniature color-video systems for medical applications, with annual sales of about $160 million, said its board determined that the company should continue to pursue its strategic plan. U.S. Surgical, based in Norwalk, Conn., is one of the world's largest manufacturers and producers of surgical instruments and has sales of about $1.1 billion. U.S. Surgical owns about 8% of Circon's outstanding common stock. Earlier this month, Circon reported disappointing earnings, which were related to its merger with Cabot Medical last year. Net income was $700,000 in the second quarter, or six cents a share, compared with year-earlier results of $300,000, or three cents a share. Prior to the announcement of U.S. Surgical's takeover bid earlier this month, Circon's stock was down 53% since its high of $23.50, reached in December. On Thursday, its shares were off 62.5 cents at $17.125 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. U.S. Surgical had said Lapierre would fit nicely with its existing businesses, pointing to synergies in selling products to doctors and hospitals and the ability to boost Circon's sales in Europe. It could also help U.S. Surgical compete against Johnson & Johnson, which has grabbed market share and helped push down pricing for surgical instruments. Analysts had speculated prior to U.S. Surgical's offer that Circon's stock drop might have made it vulnerable to a takeover. Thomasina Duggan, an analyst at Minneapolis-based Piper Jaffray Inc., noted in a report dated April 04, 2011 at prices of $9 a share or so -- where the stock was at the end of July -- possible acquirers ``are most likely calculating `what if' scenarios.'' He mentioned U.S. Surgical, J&J and others as possible buyers. Piper's analysis showed the company worth $15 or so in a takeover, below U.S. Surgical's offer. ``However, we have never gotten any indication from management that they would be amenable to a buyout,'' Mr. Duggan noted."

            "full_text": "A surgical technique that has been marketed as a way to lower the cost of hysterectomies is actually more expensive, according to two new studies. The reports found that the procedure, known as laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomy, leads to Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis charges that are 20% to 61% higher than for traditional techniques. Although patients who undergo the laparoscopic procedure get out of the Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis sooner, researchers said that longer operating time and the use of disposable instruments led to higher costs. ``The onus is on people who make the disposable instruments to show there is a benefit that outweighs these huge costs,'' said Earnest P. Renfro, vice president of Corning HTA Inc.,a medical technology assessment unit of Corning Inc.. Dr. Renfro is co-author of one of the studies, which appear in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine. Firm Disputes Findings U.S. Surgical Corp., of Conn., a leading maker of laparoscopic instruments, disputed the findings. It cited, among other things, a study done at Ames Keen, anCalif., health maintenance organization, that found the procedure ``cost-effective'' despite higher operating-room and instrument costs. Johnson & Johnson's Ethicon Endosurgery unit, U.S. Surgical's chief competitor for these instruments, said the technique provides ``significant quality-of-life advantages'' over traditional surgery, including fewer days of postoperative pain and an earlier return to normal activities. Laparoscopic surgery rose into prominence in the early 1990s, transforming gall-bladder surgery and fueling a movement in medicine to so-called minimally invasive surgery. Under the technique, doctors operate through small slits in the abdomen, avoiding the need to make a large incision that leads to longer Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis stays and longer recoveries for patients. These days, more than 80% of the 600,000 gallbladder operations performed annually in the U.S. are done laparoscopically. A few years ago, promoters predicted that many of the 600,000 hysterectomies -- especially the 60% to 70% that are done through an abdominal incision rather than through the vagina -- also would be converted to the less-invasive procedure. Doctors' Reluctance But it turned out that the technique proved difficult to apply to hysterectomies, and doctors were reluctant to adopt it, said Kyle Houle, an analyst at Montgomery Securities. Last year, according to data provided to Dr. Renfro, just 7% of the hysterectomies in the U.S. were performed with the help of laparoscopy. About 63% were done through an incision in the abdomen, and 30% were performed vaginally, he said. Thomasina G. Queen, head of gynecology at Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-, N.C., and a hysterectomy expert, said the vaginal procedure should be chosen whenever possible. Science supporting laparoscopy for hysterectomy is thin, he added, and the procedure should be confined to replacing abdominal hysterectomy. Some experts have been concerned that promotion of laparoscopy would lead some doctors to use it instead of the vaginal procedure. Expense alone doesn't mean that the laparoscopic technique shouldn't be used, as long as it is replacing the abdominal procedure, Dr. Renfro said. ``The patient may prefer it and the employer may wind up paying less when you consider how soon the patient returns to work.'' He and his colleagues are doing a separate study to see whether such benefits may outweigh the costs. For the current report, the researchers examined 1,049 procedures performed at Greater Baltimore Medical Center and found total charges, including doctors' fees, were $6,116 for laparoscopic-assisted hysterectomies, compared with $5,084 and $4,221 for abdominal and vaginal procedures, respectively. Cost differences narrowed substantially in the handful of procedures where doctors used reusable instruments, the study found. Jami H. Douglas of the center's gynecology department was lead author of the report, which was supported by the Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis. Jami H. Douglas of the medical center's gynecology department, was lead author of the report, which was supported by the Eastside Hospital, Vastopolis. The same research team is now evaluating whether the laparoscopic technique led to higher patient satisfaction and faster return to normal activities than other approaches, Dr. Renfro said. The other report, by Annelle Leonardo, a gynecologist at Cleveland Clinic Foundation, and a colleague, analyzed data covering hysterectomy procedures done at 180 Eastside Hospital, Vastopoliss between 1988 and 2009. It reached similar conclusions about costs, and it found that use of laparoscopy grew to 9.2% of cases by 1993 and then fell to 7.5% in 2009. The report was funded by J&J."

            "full_text": "Do you know what your great-grandparents died of? Did any of your ancestors suffer from cancer or diabetes or other illnesses that plague your family now? As doctors search for hereditary links for a growing number of diseases, genealogy is playing an ever-larger medical role. Information about the death and diseases in past generations can be extremely valuable in that research -- and in evaluating your own health risks. Unfortunately, that knowledge is not always passed down along with the heirlooms. The American Medical Association recommends that every family maintain some kind of health history. ``Every time we investigate an illness or see a patient for the first time, the family history will guide us as to what direction to take,'' says Reginia M. Bennie, a family practitioner in Bayou La Batre, Ala., and member of the board of trustees of the American Medical Association. ``If someone's father had a heart attack at age 35, I'd be much more aggressive in doing advanced tests over someone without that history.'' Researching back two generations is a good start, Dr. Bennie says, but she adds: ``the more, the better.'' Living relatives are the best immediate source for information, says Shizue Conley, president of the National Genealogical Society in Arlington, Va. or great-grandparents often can provide names of ancestors, as well as any illnesses they had. Much of that information may be lost when older relatives die, if no one thinks to ask. ``Pull out family photographs and ask relatives to identify these people,'' Ms. Conley says. Older generations are also more likely to keep family Bibles, wills or even personal correspondence that might mention ailing family members, she says. And sometimes even simple questions (Did you have trouble having children? How many brothers and sisters did you have?) can yield surprising information. Memories aren't perfect, however, and relatives may remember only that someone had stomach pains or recurring headaches. Sometimes they may recall inaccurate information. Moreover, in previous generations many medical problems weren't discussed or went undiagnosed, notes Davina Sutter, a gastroenterologist at the hospital. ``They didn't have CAT scans and fancy blood tests back then,'' he says. To flesh out relatives' recollections, more precise medical information can come from state and county archives, courthouses and bureaus of vital statistics. Death certificates can also offer insight into family illnesses, though they are sometimes inaccurate or incomplete. Local libraries often keep archives of old newspapers listing obituaries. If you know the names of deceased relatives but not where they lived, the Social Security Death Index, available in some libraries, provides ZIP Codes of people who have died since 1963. While becoming informed is important, doctors caution against jumping to conclusions. ``We don't want a situation where people are paranoid and start calling up doctors saying, `Aunt Mini three generations ago had colon cancer, should I be screened?' '' says Charlette Rader, a physician at the University of Riverside. Patients should be concerned mainly ``if you have more than one family member with the same problem or something unusual for your age,'' he says. Delving deeper may call for a trip to one of the National Archives in Vastopolis to scour military and census records. Before 1920, the U.S. Census Bureau counted individual families by name, and those reports are still obtainable. (Records since then are not open to the public.) The Library of Congress lists obituaries and other information, as do various ethnic heritage groups across the country. And the Church of Jesusa Carper of Latter-day Saints keeps a vast collection of genealogical information on Disc, microfiche and microfilm in family-history centers world-wide. Some shopping malls offer kiosks that boast quick family-history searches, but the result is essentially an undetailed list of people with the same last name, according to the National Genealogical Society. Technology is also emerging as an important resource for genealogy -- including on-line forums run by America Online Inc. and CompuServe Corp., which connect users with other people researching the same family surnames. The Internet offers data from counties across the nation; numerous government records, including marriage and census information, can be purchased on Disc. Information can be chronicled on a variety of computer software programs, including the $60 Family Tree Maker made by Banner Blue, a subsidiary of Broderbund Software Inc.. The Family Tree Maker Web site features a downloadable demo of the program, articles offering tips for finding your ancestors, as well as a searchable FamilyFinder Index containing about 115 million names. For those less technologically savvy, Ms. Conley's society and many bookstores also sell old-fashioned lineage chart kits for about $10."

            "full_text": "When the Pfeiffer family of Eastside got together in a park earlier this year, physicians from three states flipped hamburgers and dished potato salad. In between servings, the doctors drew blood samples from family members and filled out medical charts. The Slones carry a mutant gene for hereditary pancreatitis, a rare and painful illness that causes the pancreas to literally digest itself during attacks. Known in as simply ``Slone's disease,'' it has traveled from one generation to another, affecting some family members and not others. Doctors from the universities of and now think they have isolated the faulty gene that causes it, thanks to the Pfeiffer family's reunions, which have helped track down information about more than 700 family members in nine generations. Mapping family medical histories is at the heart of genetics research. As physicians try to establish hereditary links for diseases from cancer to diabetes, they are learning all they can about how such illnesses pass through families. By doing intricate molecular comparisons of those who are affected and those who aren't, researchers hope to pinpoint the exact genes responsible. That, in turn, may lead to tests that can predict whether offspring will have the disease or not, and ultimately to possible treatments as well. The Slones were unusually valuable for tracking the spread of a genetic illness. Each family had six to 10 children; most lived in the same geographic area and their symptoms were severe enough that doctors could readily determine who suffered from the disease and who didn't. ``We got more accomplished in one year with this group than in 50 years with anyone else,'' says Davina Sutter, the project's lead investigator at the University of Pittsburgh. Behind each new genetic discovery is a story of diligent medical sleuthing -- and often serendipity. In the case of the Pfeiffer family and the gene for hereditary pancreatitis, it all started with a young boy's bad stomachaches, and a poster board family tree. The year was 1983, and the boy was seven-year-old Khalilah Pfeiffer. From time to time, he would come home from school, vomiting and complaining of pain in his upper body. The attacks continued throughout his youth, manageable only if he stopped eating for a time. Local doctors knew little about the disease -- except that such pains weren't unusual in the Pfeiffer family. Then, one day before he started eighth grade, Khalilah told his parents, Bobette and Fetter Pfeiffer of Ky., that he needed to go to the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis. Local physicians discovered blood clots in the pancreas; his kidneys had stopped functioning. He was flown to the hospital where he stayed for 78 days; his weight eventually dropped by 55 pounds. Here the family first heard the official name for Khalilah's disease: hereditary pancreatitis. Doctors explained that the pancreas helps the intestine digest food by releasing key enzymes after meals. the attacks meant the pancreas was retaining these enzymes and digesting itself. There is no treatment other than ordinary painkillers. While death is rare, complications aren't. Sufferers sometimes develop diabetes, because the cells that make insulin are located in the pancreas. Pancreatic cancer sometimes occurs in chronic cases as well, though physicians aren't sure why. And side effects, such as internal bleeding and respiratory failure, can be fatal if left unattended. Only about 1% of the 42,500 new pancreatitis cases diagnosed each year in the U.S. are hereditary; gallstones, excessive alcohol consumption and smoking also have been linked to acute attacks. But in the Slones' case, the disease apparently sprang from a mutation in a particular gene that was passed down through the generations. Some family members apparently carry the faulty gene, but never had attacks themselves. Such ``silent carriers,'' however, can pass full-blown pancreatitis onto their children. Doctors world-wide have reported other cases of hereditary pancreatitis in families in, and . But without in-depth study, they did not understand how it traveled through the generations. Indoctors fed intravenously, forbidding even ice chips. Any eating or drinking risked inflaming his pancreas. ``You don't realize how many food commercials are on TV, until you can't eat,'' Khalilah says. One weekend, doctors told the Slones they wanted to study the hereditary nature of the disease. They asked Khalilah's father, Bobette Pfeiffer, if he had a family tree. ``I told them I had no idea about the family tree business, but I could sure learn,'' Mr. Pfeiffer recalls. Mr. Pfeiffer tracked down a friend who had written a history of . She provided a list of the area's first settlers on his father's side. Then he questioned his brothers: Did they have the pain? They in turn asked their relatives, and the list began to grow. Mr. Pfeiffer began to chronicle his findings on white poster board. With a green marker, he underlined names of relatives who'd been diagnosed with pancreatitis or recalled suffering similar pain. With an orange marker he underlined those who also had diabetes. The task made him feel useful, and he was meticulous. ``I may not be a doctor or a research scientist,'' Mr. Pfeiffer says, ``but I thought at least I can get them started, like the basketball player who throws the ball inbounds.'' Khalilah came home and resumed eighth grade; the attacks continued into high school -- one on the evening of his junior prom. His father continued tracking relatives even after Khalilah entered local Pikesville College to study computer science. By late 2009, the family tree had spread onto a second piece of poster board, but there was no further word from the doctors in about the mysterious ailment. Then one Sunday last year, Mr. and Mrs. Pfeiffer came home from church to find curled in a ball on the floor. He was rushed to the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis. Blood vessels in his pancreas had ruptured, and only 20% of the organ functioned; the rest was scar tissue. Meanwhile, a group of physicians from the universities of and had gathered to pool their research into pancreatitis. They decided to focus on the hereditary version, and see if they could isolate the mutant gene that caused the disease. They hoped that would give them further insight into all types of pancreatitis. But to do so, they needed to find an extended family that carried the disease and was willing and able to share their ancestors' medical history. Their first lead was a 1972 research paper written by two physicians at the University of Indiana that cited an ``S.'' family with the disease living in . Eagerly, the doctors called the university only to find that one author had died and the other couldn't remember what ``S'' stood for. Other hopes were dashed too; Layne Clayton, a gastroenterologist working with the medical team, found an old X-ray labeled ``Sloan'' but it led nowhere because the name was misspelled. One afternoon, Dr. Clayton got a phone call from the Southville Hospital, Vastopolis. It was an associate, Nickolas Coen. ``You'll never believe this,'' Dr. Coen said. ``I've got a 19-year-old kid here with chronic pancreatitis. His name is Khalilah Pfeiffer.'' Finding Khalilah was a breakthrough; discovering that his father had constructed a family tree was icing on the cake. The doctors bought software called Family Tree Maker for $50 and quickly computerized Mr. Pfeiffer's hand-scrawled notations. Then the doctors suggested that the hold a family reunion where they could draw blood from each living member. Eager to assist, Mr. Pfeiffer called everyone he knew and even went on the radio to discuss the disease and ask relatives to attend the reunion. ``Bobette did the core of the work,'' says Dr. Sutter, the lead investigator. ``After seeing the suffering his son was going through, I imagine he'd do anything to prevent it. He was extraordinary.'' On Memorial Day weekend, 2010, doctors and their wives packed food to feed the entire Pfeiffer family and drove to Breaks Interstate Park, bordering and . Slone relatives started arriving -- 90 of them in all -- carrying thick family Bibles chronicling marriages, christenings, deaths. Throughout the day, doctors served food and drew blood, asked questions and filled in blanks on Mr. Pfeiffer's growing family tree. A local nurse helped and later gathered blood samples from still more Slones who couldn't attend. The blood was taken towhere researchers extracted the gene-containing DNA from the white-blood cells. The DNA, sliced into fragments, was then exposed to genetic probes carrying radioactive tracers. As the probes stuck to different fragments of DNA, the researchers could identify fragments carried by some family members, but not by others. Their hope was to find a DNA fragment that was possessed by all the relatives who had pancreatitis, but by none of the relatives who were free of the disorder. Such a fragment presumably would possess the mutant gene that was causing the ailment. Doctors needed samples from as many family members as possible to reduce the possibility that the findings were merely the result of chance. In February, doctors narrowed the search for the faulty gene to a small region on the seventh chromosome. But they needed more blood samples and medical histories to make certain, so they asked for a second reunion. Again they held the picnic in . This time, 45 Slones came and doctors drew blood from those they hadn't sampled before. The family tree now comprised 700 names on 20 feet of computer paper. A few weeks later, doctors believed they had the gene. Now, if final testing confirms their finding, researchers inled by gastroenterologist Charlette Rader Schuster, will put the mutant gene into a mouse and begin testing therapeutic regimens. Those could include dietary restrictions, hormone therapy or inhibitors to prevent the pancreas from releasing enzymes at the wrong time. Doctors admit they don't know if they can find anything to help Khalilah or this generation of . But the information has already proved useful to a new generation. Khalilah's sister, Chrystal, who never had an attack herself, recently gave birth to a son. Doctors were able to determine that Chrystal is not a carrier, so her son will not suffer hereditary pancreatitis. Khalilah Pfeiffer, who never returned to college after his last hospital stay, works for his father, who now has a sporting-goods shop. ``I know my children may have this pain,'' he says. ``But I still think life is wonderful. And maybe doctors will find something to help my kids.'' --Michaele Brough contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Most corporations at the Republican Convention are out to get all the attention they can. But the tobacco industry isn't so easy to find. In a daily game of cat and mouse, demonstrators from the American Lung Association seek out tobacco-industry functions. A luncheon for the GOP's Texas delegation had just begun, when suddenly the drapes were closed in the hotel ballroom. The reason: to block out three protesters with signs attacking the event's sponsor, Philip Morris Cos.. Facing more public pressure than ever, the tobacco industry has as much at stake in a GOP victory in November as any industry. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration forwarded to the White House its draft of a new rule that would ban tobacco marketing deemed accessible to minors. And just last week, the industry lost a landmark court decision in Florida to a lung-cancer sufferer and his wife. Tobacco executives are counting on a GOP Congress or a GOP president as their best friend to fend off the attack. Low Profile Phillip Morton, the industry leader, donated some $500,000 to the host committee to help put on the convention. The industry has given $4.8 million to the Republican Party in the past 19 months, including $1.8 million from Philip Morris. But here in Vastopolis, the industry is generally taking a low-key approach. Both Phillip Morton and U.S. Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc., have boats docked in the marina behind the convention site, where they entertain small groups of people. But only official convention-goers, who can clear the security checks, can reach their floating parties. The industry has largely taken to hosting small gatherings for state delegations or individual lawmakers. RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., parent of the nation's second-largest tobacco concern, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., held a reception for Rep. Thomasena J. Batton (R., Va.), chairman of the House Commerce Committee and one of the company's best friends in Congress. Philip Morris has entertained several delegations, including those from Connecticut and New York, as well as sponsored a trip to the Trujillo library. Even this level of participation has delivered them access: At the Texas lunch, Jackeline Alston, a company vice president, was seated at the head table between Sen. Kayce Henley (R., Texas) and State Party Chairman Tomas Elliot. At the Democratic convention in Chicago two weeks away, the involvement will be starkly different. Philip Morris will sponsor only two delegate parties, for Virginia and Kentucky, while no other tobacco companies will host events. Moreover, Phillip Morton made a $100,000 donation to Chicago's host committee in the name of its subsidiary, Kraft Foods Inc.. Controversy Over Art Despite the low profile, the tobacco makers haven't avoided controversy. The biggest flap involves Phillip Morton's backdoor sponsorship of an event at Vastopolis's Museum of Art. Months ago, the company was negotiating with the museum to sponsor an exhibit by artist Debra Yee and to hold functions there during the convention. After protests from antismoking groups, the museum announced that Phillip Morton wouldn't be using the facility. Yet on Monday, a reception for the Georgia delegation, including House Speaker Cannon Geis (R., Ga.), was held there. Phillip Morton was among the corporate sponsors. How did it happen? Museum officials insist they didn't know the sponsors. Fortune Dennise, director of communications for Philip Morris, says, ``We gave money ... for the function. They (Georgia delegation) chose where to hold it.''"

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- A federal district judge here tentatively approved a legal settlement that would pay $100,000 each to Americans with hemophilia who contracted AIDS or HIV, the AIDS virus, from blood-clotting medications between 1978 and 1985. Judge Johna F. Graham granted preliminary approval to the settlement between hemophiliacs and manufacturers Bayer AG, Baxter International Inc., Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.'s Armour Pharmaceutical Co. division and the Alpha Therapeutic Corp. unit of Green Cross Corp. of Japan. Various producers already have agreed to settlements of the hemophilia cases in other countries, most recently in Japan. The U.S. settlement originally called for a total fund of $640 million, with payments that theoretically could shrink if more people signed up to participate than had been predicted. However, the companies now have agreed that the fund could increase if such an eventuality occurred, though they have said they don't expect this to take place. Spouses, family members and survivors are eligible to participate. The court ordered that a formal notice of the agreement be widely disseminated. At issue in the litigation were cases of AIDS and HIV contracted through medications called Factor VIII and Factor IX, which hemophiliacs take to make their blood clot. Between 6,000 and 10,000 American hemophiliacs are estimated to have gotten the virus from the clotting factors, of whom about 3,000 have died. The hemophiliacs contend the companies sold the products after they knew AIDS was blood borne, but the companies say most people were infected before enough was known about the cause of AIDS."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- The craze that has transformed cigars from fat cats' stinky stogies to yuppie status symbols has touched down on Wall Street. Shares of Consolidated Cigar Inc., maker of Dutch Masters and El Productos and controlled by financier Ronda Flory, rose 23% Friday on their first day of trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's rise at a time when new stock offerings have been sluggish illustrates the power of the cigar industry's recent boom. Even as the cigarette industry is threatened with tough regulations, cigars have come into vogue -- and fresh demand is pushing sales of stogies higher. Retail cigar sales in the United States topped $1 billion last year, up from $860 million in 2009 and $705 million five years ago, according to the Cigar Association of America. Nearly 4 billion cigars were sold last year. Beyond a new social cachet, cigars also have taken on an image as a male-bonding tool. ``It has kind of a nice macho air,'' said Markita Mckenna of Bogota, N.J., a new smoker perusing the shelves at the Nat Sherman tobacco shop in Manhattan, which sells cigars that cost as much as $28 each. ``I just bought a Victorian house, and I'm looking for things to do on the porch. Drinking every night is too cumbersome,'' said Mr. Mckenna, a writer and producer for an MTV radio show and a creative director for record labels. Once the domain of older men, cigars have attracted a younger breed of smokers, both male and female. And much like the homemade-style brews fueling the microbrewery beer rage, fancier handcrafted cigars are spurring the industry's resurgence. ``Cheap cigars stink. But a handmade premium cigar has a beautiful bouquet and has a very attractive smell,'' said Marya R. Francesca, editor and publisher of Cigar Aficionado magazine, whose introduction in 1992 helped inspire the burgeoning cigar trend. Mr. Francesca said the number of male cigar smokers in the 21-35 age range has surged in the past two years. The sharp jump in demand for cigars -- particularly from smokers like Mr. Mckenna who prefer premium brands -- has caught the industry off-guard, said Novella Daniel, president of the Washington-based Cigar Association. As a result, manufacturers have struggled to keep up with demand and now face a worldwide shortage in quality tobacco and skilled labor to make the handrolled brands, Mr. Daniel said. Premium brands account for just 8% of the cigars sold in the United States but account for 33% in dollar terms. But investors showed no fear in diving into Consolidated Cigar's stock Friday, making it the second cigar stock to make a powerful debut on the market. Initially priced at $23 each, Consolidated's 5.4 million shares -- trading under the stock symbol CIG -- opened Friday at $26.25 and leaped to $28.375 by the market's close. Both the price and the size of the deal were raised from original targets of 4.5 million shares expected to fetch between $18 and $21 a share. The smaller Caribbean Cigar Co. began trading April 13, 2011 the Nasdaq Stock Market, with its shares jumping to a high of $14 after being priced at $7. But the stock has flattened since, closing Friday at $11.50. The other cigar maker with publicly-traded stock is Culbro Corp., a diversified company whose General Cigar unit makes popular brands like Macanudo and Garcia y Glover. Though its Big Board-listed stock has dipped recently, Culbro shares rose 10% Friday to $53.50, far above $13, where the stock hovered at the beginning of 2010."

            "full_text": "More than two years after its much heralded introduction, Monsanto Co.'s bovine growth hormone has yet to firmly establish its place in America's barns. Monsanto had hoped the synthetic hormone, Posilac, would lead American agriculture into the era of biotechnology and revolutionize the dairy industry by making cows produce more milk. At the same time, the product sparked loud consumer complaints over possible health hazards from drinking milk produced by hormone-treated cows. In the end, however, economics and bad timing -- not consumer opposition -- have been the main factors limiting the product's appeal. Use of Posilac -- at $5.80 a dose -- drove up dairy farmers' already soaring feed costs and interfered with their traditional breeding routines. ``Posilac is a lot more complicated than a lot of dairymen bargained for,'' says Jefferson Tello, a Wisconsin dairy farmer who uses Posilac aggressively on his 525 head of cattle. ``It's been a very hard sell for Monsanto.'' Indeed, a survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture shows that only 10% of the nation's 9.4 million dairy cows in early 2011 were receiving transgenic bovine somatotropin, ``considerably fewer than the number thought to be using BST in early 1995.'' Monsanto doesn't quarrel with the 10% figure, but says Posilac sales volumes have risen and that the product recently turned its first profit. To help stimulate demand, Monsanto last fall began offering loyal BST users a 10% discount. While the St. Louis company won't disclose sales figures, data supplied by Monsanto to the Food and Drug Administration estimate annual sales at about $90 million. That represents something of a disappointment for a product Wall Street thought would lift Monsanto profits. Some securities analysts predicted in early 2009 that up to 70% of U.S. milk would eventually come from BST-treated cows and that sales would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars -- the amount Monsanto spent to develop the drug. Instead, Michaele F. Rademacher, dairy specialist at the University of Illinois, Urbana, figures that only about 8% of all Illinois dairy cows are receiving the hormone. Typically, a syringe full of BST every other week can boost a cow's daily milk production by 10%. The cost of feeding livestock soared this summer as corn supplies fell to their lowest levels in nearly 50 years. And cows must eat more grain to produce more milk. ``Monsanto couldn't pick a worse time to push a cow product,'' Cornell University economist Markita Rojas says. Mikki Wrigley of Le Center, Minn., says he uses BST on just five cows in his 300-head dairy herd. His BST-treated cows produce about 12 more pounds of milk a day -- a 20% gain over untreated cows. ``But the more milk they make the more they eat,'' said Mr. Wrigley. ``And good quality feed is tight.'' And when it's hot outside, cows eat less, weakening BST's effectiveness. BST has also forced users to micromanage their herds. Mr. Tello says he has had to delay annual breeding schedules for cows treated with BST. The trade-off: He clears an extra $80 on a cow that typically produced $800 a year in milk, but he has fewer cows to sell to slaughterhouses. ``To get the maximum benefit (of BST) you have to think about calving differently ... that goes against hundreds of years of conventional wisdom,'' concedes Monsanto's Jesica Shaver, head of U.S. marketing for Posilac. For many farmers, the incremental milk profits aren't worth chasing. U.S. dairy cows are already prolific (the average cow produces more than 16,000 pounds annually). And maintaining their health at those production levels is enough of a challenge. Roberto Cascio, a Montgomery, Minn., farmer, says he experimented with BST on a handful of his 85 dairy cows last year, then quit. ``You can only push a cow so hard,'' he says. BST has been the least popular in the milk-belt states of Wisconsin and Minnesota, where small farmers fear the technology will cause a glut that eventually drives down milk prices. University surveys suggest only 6.6% of Wisconsin dairy farmers had adopted BST by the spring of 2010. Uptown dairy farmers have been among the most accepting of BST, in part because Cornell University did a lot of early research on the hormone. But Mr. Rojas of Cornell figures BST use there is dropping as dairy farmers attempt to cut expenses. And farmers continue to worry about consumer reaction to BST, even though the government says BST-treated milk is safe. A University of Wisconsin study released in January and funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that two-thirds of the 1,900 consumers interviewed were moderately to very concerned about the safety of milk from BST-treated herds. Vermont last year passed a law requiring milk from BST-treated cows to be labeled as such, though the Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recently blocked enforcement. In May, three prominent dairy companies sued Illinois and the city of Downtown for the right to say their products are free of synthetic hormones. Dairy concern Land O'Lakes Inc., based in Arden Hills, Minn., began advertising its non-BST milk two years ago and says sales have climbed steadily. It buys milk from farmers who sign affidavits stating they don't use BST. Gay Benoit, chief executive of milk-processor Clover Stornetta Farms Inc., Petaluma, Calif., says he recently began paying dairymen to avoid BST. ``It's that big an issue for our customers,'' he says. Monsanto, meanwhile, still has hopes that its marketing drive will eventually boost sales of BST, which is currently made in Austria. Facing unfavorable currency exchanges and high manufacturing costs there, the company plans to build a BST plant in Augusta, Ga. ``This is a real growth product for Monsanto,'' Mr. Shaver says."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- New research bolstered hopes that estrogen replacement therapy after menopause can help delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease. Researchers in    who have been monitoring the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease in more than 1,100 elderly women said that the women who began taking estrogen after menopause have had a markedly lower incidence of the mind-robbing disorder. So far, only 6% of the estrogen users have developed Alzheimer's disease compared with 16% of the women who had never taken the synthetic hormone, the researchers reported in this week's issue of the medical journal, The Lancet. (The article is available at The Lancet's Web site at Registration is required.) Statisticians calculated that a woman who took estrogen for at least 10 years after menopause has a 30% to 40% lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease than a woman of the same age who hadn't taken the hormone. Most of the women in the study had used the Premarin brand of estrogen made by the Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories division of American Home Products Corp.. Such population or epidemiological studies aren't conclusive but ``this is the most compelling evidence so far that estrogen has a beneficial effect'' in thwarting Alzheimer's disease, said neurologist Richelle Tweedy, who headed the research team at the Smogtown Hospital, Smogtown. Search to Continue ``This study gives us a tremendous boost, not only to proceed with clinical trials of estrogen for Alzheimer's disease, but also to search for even more effective drugs with fewer or no side effects,'' said Bethea Jaco, director the Alzheimer's Association's Reagan Research Institute in . A $16 million clinical trial to determine for sure whether estrogen will stave off Alzheimer's disease is currently being organized as part of the federal government's Women's Health Initiative, launched in 1991. Funded by Wyeth-Ayerst, the trial will test the mental acuity of 8,000 elderly women annually for six to nine years to see if the incidence of Alzheimer's disease is any different in those taking estrogen than in those taking a placebo. Columbia-Presbyterian's Dr. Tweedy emphasized that the evidence from the new study still wasn't strong enough for the researchers to recommend that postmenopausal women generally should begin taking estrogen. Nevertheless, the new evidence may well influence doctors' and women's decisions on whether the benefits of estrogen after menopause outweigh the treatment's risks. Women taking estrogen for the long term run a higher risk of endometrial cancer and possibly breast cancer, according to some controversial studies. However, the treatment also sharply reduces the risk of heart disease and of the bone-thinning disease, osteoporosis. Addition of Progestin Hormone Earlier this week, researchers at Harvard University reported that the addition of a so-called progestin hormone to the estrogen doesn't alter the treatment's known ability to reduce the risk of heart disease in aging women. In the study, financed by the federal National Institute on Aging, the scientists began five years ago to enlist women over the age of 70 years for the study. The 1,124 women who have volunteered so far were mentally healthy at the time they volunteered, and agreed to undergo periodic tests for Alzheimer's disease."

            "full_text": "Circon Corp. is circling the wagons, rejecting U.S. Surgical Corp.'s unsolicited $230 million takeover bid and installing a so-called poison-pill shareholder rights plan. Lapierre, a Santa Barbara, Calif., maker of surgical products, said it wasn't for sale and that the offer of $18 a share was ``inadequate'' in the opinion of its financial adviser, Bear Stearns & Co.. Shares of Circon fell 62.5 cents to $17.125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market Thursday after jumping to over $19 following the tender offer, announced April 14, 2011 shares were trading under $9 in late July, and U.S. Surgical points out that the offer was an 83% premium over the average closing price of the stock for the 10-day period prior to the bid. Thursday, U.S. Surgical rose 37.5 cents to $35.75 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shareholder rights plan effectively stops U.S. Surgical, a Norwalk, Conn., maker of surgical instruments, from acquiring 15% or more of the company by making it prohibitively expensive through the issuance of shares at a discount. U.S. Surgical purchased about 8% of the shares of Circon before announcing its bid. Company insiders and former executives own a significant stake in Circon. While companies often call unsolicited bids inadequate to squeeze a better price from the bidders, Lapierre appears to be girding for battle, hiring a crew of financial, legal and public-relations takeover advisers. It's unclear what U.S. Surgical's next move will be, if any, given Circon's tough defenses. Circon doesn't have an annual meeting until July 2012, and it has a staggered board of directors. A spokesman for Legrand said shareholders can't act by written consent or call a special meeting, two tacks sometimes used by hostile suitors. Some analysts believe the fit between Circon and U.S. Surgical is compelling for the bigger company in that it broadens its product line and marketing abilities. U.S. Surgical is one of the world's largest makers of surgical instruments, with annual sales of $1.1 billion. In July 2010, Circon shareholders approved changes in the company's charter so investors cannot act by written consent -- a provision that effectively allows investors to run a slate of directors to oust a board. But the amendment wasn't actually filed and put into the Delaware charter until March 28, 2011 Thomasina Duggan, an analyst at Piper Jaffray Inc., said the move by Circon wasn't surprising. But, he said, ``I look forward to continuing negotiations between U.S. Surgical, Circon, and possibly other parties. I don't think this is the end. The ball's back in U.S. Surgical's court.''"

FoxMeyer took $59.9 million in charges in the third quarter and $34 million in charges in the fourth quarter, both related to tie-ups at the center. Among other things, the company said inventories at the distribution center failed to match up with the company's computer records, resulting in incorrect shipments and erroneous invoices and prompting the write-downs. In addition, unfavorable contracts have resulted in too-low margins. Khalilah Ream, Boykins's general counsel, declined to comment on negotiations or identify potential buyers but said the company would have named a committed buyer had one stepped forward. Last month, company officials said in an interview that they had held talks with potential suitors who weren't identified. After selling the unit, FoxMeyer would have only a small health-products division, a medical-claim information service and assorted assets, including securities and real estate. FoxMeyer also said it expects to report a first-quarter loss from continuing operations of $2 million. In the year-earlier period, the company had net income, after a charge from discontinued operations, of $6.9 million. The company, which at one time also owned a retailer, has always operated as a holding company. It said that after a sale, it will seek another acquisition or business transaction. Mr. Ream said the company, for example, might seek a greater relationship with Phar-Mor Inc., the drugstore chain; Bianco owns a 30% stake in Phar-Mor, acquired through the chain's bankruptcy reorganization. Mr. Ream said the company beneficially owns an additional 10% of Phar-Mor through a partnership. The announcement was made after the close of New York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday. FoxMeyer closed at $8, down 12.5 cents."

            "full_text": "The two executives running Prudential Insurance Co. of America's giant health-care business are stepping down, reflecting the parent's growing dissatisfaction with the unit's sagging financial performance. Some analysts said the moves could even herald the unit's possible sale. The company said Williemae P. Browne, 49 years old, chief executive officer of Prudential HealthCare Group since 1993, and Sanda H. Ely, 52, the unit's president since October, took early retirement. They are the latest in a series of longtime Prudential executives to step aside as Arvilla Sabina, chairman since late 2009, installs his own management team. In a five-sentence memo distributed to employees Thursday, Mr. Sabina said he would assume the position of CEO of the unit beginning Monday and launch a search for a permanent head of the unit. Insurance Carriers' Struggle The retirements of two veterans, each with more than 25 years of service with Prudential, are another sign of the struggle the nation's traditional insurance carriers are having in competing with managed-care concerns. Last month, Aetna Inc. completed its $8 billion acquisition of U.S. Healthcare Inc., a move designed to acquire managed-care expertise. Previously, Metra Health, itself a merger of the former health lines of Travelers Group and Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., was acquired by United HealthCare Corp., the big Minneapolis managed-care company. ``Prudential has had tough competition,'' says Jimmy O'Romo, managing consultant for Frances Ingram, a benefits-consulting firm in Cornertown. ``They've lost market share (in the Cornertown area). They're trying to restructure.'' Among big managed-care accounts Prudential has lost recently are VastComm Network Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp., both of which were won by U.S. Healthcare, a leading health-maintenance organization before its acquisition by Aetna. The American Association of Retired Persons recently announced its intent to put out for bid a $3 billion-a-year contract for supplemental health insurance, long held by Prudential. Overhaul of Health-Care Operations Analysts expect Mr. Sabina to look outside the company for successors. In replacing top executives in the company's big life-insurance operations, where he has focused much attention since coming aboard, he has hired from other financial-services companies. Mr. O'Romo thinks the company will seek someone with significant background in operating HMOs. In any event, some overhaul of Prudential's health-care operations is likely, including a retrenchment in regional markets where the company's position is relatively weak, analysts said. The unit, with $11.3 billion in revenue, barely turned a profit last year and has lagged far behind peers who generally deliver at least a 3% to 4% return on revenue, analysts said. That marginal profitability comes even as stepped-up investment is needed in HMOs. ``They have to make some significant choices here: Do they make the investment to stay in and position themselves for success or do they sell all or a part of it?'' said Lasandra Merriam, a senior vice president at A.M. Best Co., an insurance-ratings service. For its part, Prudential adamantly denies that the company is for sale. ``We intend to build and grow the business,'' a spokesman said."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- Medaphis Corp.'s stock plummeted 60% after the company stunned the investment community by forecasting a large third-quarter loss. Medaphis, which provides business-management and information-technology services to the health-care industry, disclosed that it expects to post a third-quarter loss of between 28 cents and 33 cents a share and charges against earnings of up to $40 million. Analysts were looking for the company, which has been a Wall Street favorite, to earn about 27 cents a share in the quarter. In heavy trading of 42,903,400 shares on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Medaphis stock plunged $21.375 to close at $14.25 Thursday. Wall Street reacted with ``extreme surprise and disappointment'' to the earnings forecast since ``Medaphis has been a premiere company for a number of years,'' said Hambrecht & Quist analyst Domingo Devin. ``This company just didn't make these kinds of mistakes.'' Medaphis, which disclosed the news of the impending loss after the market closed Wednesday, primarily attributed its troubles to two units: continued weakness in Medaphis Physician Services Corp.'s business and a reorganization of Imonics, a fast-growing division that provides systems-integration services for various companies, including MPSC. Warner said it will take an $11 million charge in the quarter for restructuring costs associated with MPSC, which provides billing and accounts-receivable-management services and generates about 36% of the company's revenue. In addition, Warner said it will take a $9 million charge related to restructuring a large agreement with Imonics' European joint venture. It will also take a $15 million charge for the overall restructuring of Imonics. Medaphis will take up to $5 million in other charges mainly to cover accounting and professional fees relating to the restructuring. Many of Warner's woes originated with the fast growth of Imonics, according to Ranee Dean, chairman, president and chief executive. ``It was having trouble keeping up with its growth rate,'' Mr. Dean said in an interview. Those problems, in turn, delayed MPSC's re-engineering efforts, he said. ``We've been signaling the Street for two quarters that we've been involved in that struggle'' with MPSC, Mr. Dean said. To help compensate for the weakness in MPSC's business, Mr. Dean said, ``we have, in effect, been making diving catches,'' including acquisitions that enhanced earnings. Warner has forged a series of deals since the first of the year and has unveiled 43 acquisitions in the past nine years. But some analysts believe Warner's troubles are more complex. ``Medaphis has done a number of things that have been problematic,'' said Smith Barney analyst Keli Sharp. For one thing, ``they diverted from their original business by making a series of acquisitions, including some they had no experience with,'' he said. In addition, Medaphis's ``somewhat aggressive'' accounting ``always left them with very little room to maneuver,'' Mr. Sharp said. ``It's a management team that took on an awful lot too quickly.'' In the year-earlier third quarter, the company said, it posted a restated loss of $3.1 million, or five cents a share, including $14 million in restructuring charges, on $140.8 million in revenue. For all of 2012, the company said it expects earnings per share in the range of 75 cents to 90 cents, down from analysts' estimates of $1.42."

            "full_text": "SmithKline Beecham PLC signed a marketing partnership with the American Cancer Society in connection with the health-care company's launch of nonprescription nicotine patch as a device to help people stop smoking. The patch, which went on sale Friday, bears the American Cancer Society's logo. For lending its name, the cancer society received $1 million, which it said will be used to launch a public education and health awareness campaign. Under the contract, the program will be renewable at the end of the campaign year, said a spokesman for the society. The cancer society previously announced a similar marketing campaign with the Northville Department of Citrus, a trade association, which oversees manufacturing and marketing of Northville orange juice. The educational program on the role of nutrition in cancer will be launched next month. The partnership with SmithKline is the first such arrangement covering a pharmaceutical product. The spokesman said the cancer society is currently negotiating such partnerships with a couple of other companies, but on the nicotine patch SmithKline will be the exclusive partner. The British pharmaceutical company's U.S. headquarters are in Philadelphia. ``We were impressed by the multifaceted aspect of SmithKline's smoking-cessation program,'' said the spokesman, referring to the booklets and audio tapes and other devices used to help quitters control their urges. ``We both have a common mission to get smokers to quit.'' SmithKline rival Johnson & Johnson said it wasn't worried by the cancer society's endorsement of a rival product. Johnson & Johnson, based in New Brunswick, N.J., introduced its nonprescription nicotine patch last month. ``Our product is simpler to use and is less costly,'' said a spokesman. A 10-week regimen with SmithKline's over-the-counter patch will cost the consumer $300, and an eight-week program for lighter smokers will cost $240, the company said. Johnson & Johnson said its patch calls for a six-week regimen, at $30 a week, for a total of $180. Prescription patches to help quit smoking have been available since 1991. Their sales peaked at $600 million annually soon after their introduction, but have now dropped to about $250 million a year. Companies believe that sales will rise with nonprescription patches."

            "full_text": "One of FoxMeyer Health Corp.'s top executives said the company is thinking about putting itself on the block after it sells its massive but unprofitable drug-distribution business. In an interview, Abby J. Foster, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer, said the company hasn't yet decided what it will do after the hoped-for sale of its FoxMeyer Drug Co. unit. However, he said, the Dallas-based holding company would have $350 million in miscellaneous assets, and its only liabilities would be $150 million in preferred stock. That, combined with $325 million in tax benefits and additional capital losses, might make it tempting to another company, especially because Boykins said it will slowly liquidate its other assets. As reported last week, the company said late Thursday that it is looking for a buyer for its drug-distribution business because it believes another company could manage it better. In response, FoxMeyer's shares fell 14% Friday, to close at $6.875, down $1.125, in Westside Stock Exchange composite trading. The drug-distribution business accounted for the vast majority of the company's sales of $5.5 billion for the year ended December 11, 2010 Situation Still, some analysts said FoxMeyer might have a hard time getting a decent bid for its troubled drug operations. ``FoxMeyer is not in the strongest position to negotiate the highest possible price. They're not hitting on all eight cylinders,'' said Donetta T. Codi, an analyst with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.. FoxMeyer reported massive losses in its third and fourth quarters of its December 11, 2010 year because of inventory and bad-debt write-downs related to problems with a huge new distribution center in Riverside Court House, Ohio. The company also blamed contracts at unfavorable prices that it had hoped would look better when the distribution center began operations. Analysts also said the company, unlike some of its competitors, had failed to diversify into new areas to help pharmacies cope with managed care. Two of the biggest -- Bergen Brunswig Corp. of Orange, Calif., and McKesson Corp. of San Francisco -- offer added incentives to keep drugstore customers. That includes training and other services related to managed care, which accounts for more than half of today's prescriptions. Possible Buyers Analysts said the most likely candidates to buy the business would be the top drug-distribution concerns, but they might not want it. The competitors could snatch up FoxMeyer's customers without acquiring the company because independent drugstores might switch on their own, said Sam L. Judson, an analyst with Fourteen Research Corp. ``Sooner or later, any customer of FoxMeyer's wouldn't get the services they require, and would almost have to go to someone who can provide the services,'' she said. Mckay declined to comment, while Wyckoff Milford didn't return calls seeking comment. FoxMeyer's Mr. Foster declined to speculate about what sort of price the drug-distribution business might fetch. ``We built a computer system and infrastructure in which we put in lots of money. I think it will have a value for someone,'' he said. Separately, Mr. Foster said the company doesn't have plans to strengthen its relationship with drugstore chain Phar-Mor Inc. of Youngstown, Ohio, in which it beneficially owns about a 40% stake. A company spokesman previously said that such a move was one example of how the company might leverage its assets to enter into a new business after selling the drug unit."

            "full_text": "ATLANTA -- The American Stock Exchange and the Chicago Board Options Exchange are reviewing the unusually high volume of bearish bets on the options of Medaphis Corp. last week. Shortly before Medaphis stunned the investment community by forecasting a large third-quarter loss, the volume in ``put'' options -- options that give the buyer the right to sell stock at a set price -- shot up, raising the issue of whether any traders had advance knowledge of the bad news. For example, puts with a strike price of $30 and set to expire at the end of September had trades on the American Stock Exchange of 40 contracts last Monday, 90 contracts on Tuesday and 222 contracts on Wednesday, although Warner didn't release the news of the loss until after the close of trading Wednesday. Also on the American Stock Exchange, puts with a strike price of $35 with expiration dates over the weekend had trades of 20 contracts each on Monday and Tuesday, with a surge to 90 contracts on Wednesday. When the stock market reacted to the news on Thursday, Medaphis shares plummeted 60%. They closed Friday on the Nasdaq Stock Market at $13.438, down 81.25 cents, or 5.7%. Medaphis, which provides business-management and information-technology services to the health-care industry, disclosed Wednesday that it expects to post a third-quarter loss of between 28 cents and 33 cents a share and charges against earnings of up to $40 million. Analysts were expecting the company, a Wall Street favorite, to earn about 27 cents a share in the quarter. The American Stock Exchange is ``looking into'' the trading activity of the put options, a spokesman confirmed, but added that he couldn't ``confirm or deny an investigation is under way.'' The Chicago Board Options Exchange also confirmed that it is ``following our routine review procedures as they relate to multiple-listed options,'' a spokesman said. Williemae R. Samantha, Warner's general counsel, said, ``The company took all appropriate steps to preclude the misuse of material nonpublic information.'' He added that Warner ``intends to fully cooperate with any investigation that may arise'' from the unusual trading in the company's put options."

            "full_text": "The biggest health-maintenance organization in the U.S., Ames Keen, and a leading doctors' group are jointly calling for new federal legislation that would expand health plans' coverage of emergency-medical services. The proposal by Ames and the American College of Emergency Physicians marks an unusual attempt by HMOs and organized medicine to work together in defusing a health-insurance controversy. In the past few years, doctors' groups have repeatedly clashed with HMOs over issues from maternity stays to mental-health benefits. So far, emergency coverage has been one of the feistiest battlegrounds. Some States Step In Even as cost-minded health plans take steps to stop paying for what they regard as unwarranted emergency-room visits, various doctors and patients have complained that these restrictions go too far. Since 2009, nine states, including Maryland, Virginia and New York, have passed bills that guarantee health-plan members greater emergency-care benefits than their HMO might otherwise offer. Emergency coverage ``has been a problem for patients'' in HMOs, acknowledged Patrina Annita, a Kaiser executive and emergency-room doctor, who helped draft the new accord. Dr. Annita said the proposed standards ``would mean a big change in the status quo,'' but ``will give members the peace of mind that they need.'' The proposed standards were quickly endorsed by Rep. Bennie Buller, a Maryland Democrat who has been pushing for federal legislation on HMO emergency services. ``We've been encouraging these discussions,'' he said. ``We're very pleased.'' An emergency-services bill introduced by Rep. Cancel last year has attracted 140 co-sponsors but hasn't been voted on and is considered unlikely to go anywhere before the November elections. Still, Rep. Cancel predicted that the next health-care bill that Congress passes will include a more liberal definition of emergency coverage that health plans will be obliged to follow. Gaynor of Proposal The centerpiece of the Kaiser accord with emergency doctors is a proposal that health plans be required to pay for emergency services if a ``prudent layperson'' could reasonably expect his or her condition to result in serious health impairment. That standard has been aggressively championed the past few years by physician lobbyists. It would essentially end health plans' ability to deny payment if seemingly grave symptoms such as severe chest pains turn out to be false alarms. Health plans have saved money by applying that stricter test, but also have upset doctors and some patients by refusing, after the fact, to pay for as much as 30% of emergency-room visits. The doctors' group gave ground in other areas, though. In its accord, it acknowledged that emergency physicians should contact HMOs promptly, so they can agree jointly on how to treat patients once they are stabilized. The emergency doctors' group also conceded that not all patient visits will meet the ``prudent layperson'' test, and said that patients themselves must bear the costs of unwarranted visits. ``This is not a green light for everyone to show up in the emergency room,'' said Gretchen Herma, president of the emergency physicians' group. The new standards still would let health plans deny coverage for patients who come to the emergency room wanting prescription refills or minor stitches removed, Dr. Herma observed. In Oakland, Calif., Ames officials said they hope other health plans will endorse the proposed new emergency standards. A spokesman for Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York in New York City said that HMO has begun talks with Ames and is interested in the proposal but hasn't yet reached a decision. ``We want this to be a role model for how medical providers and HMOs ought to do business,'' Dr. Herma said. ``What's happened in the past is that both groups have got frustrated at each other and taken it out in public. Now we think managed-care plans and people who represent providers can sit down and work things out.''"

            "full_text": "``Nobody talked to me about psychological problems after bypass. In those days, it was treated as a plumbing problem,'' he recalls. ``We were euphoric that I survived the surgery, and then I fell into this hole.'' Depression -- mild or major -- affects about half of the one million heart-attack survivors, and about 30% to 40% of the 350,000 bypass patients, in the U.S. each year. It is a common aftereffect, long undertreated, that can hinder recovery. Now doctors and researchers are giving it close attention. Fortunately, the malaise is often temporary. Mr. Chitwood of Seattle shook his depression while pursuing a new career in cardiac rehabilitation. Others aren't so lucky. Until recently, few doctors treated the psychological aftermath of heart attack or lifesaving heart surgery. In the early days of bypass, cardiac pioneers struggled to heal the heart, prevent major complications such as stroke and simply keep people alive. Besides, many antidepressants used then were toxic to the heart, and so too dangerous for cardiac patients. Now that survival rates can approach 98% among bypass patients -- and safer antidepressants have hit the market -- doctors can turn their attention to improving the quality of life after surgery. In fact, alleviating depression may mean life itself. Studies in Montreal found people with untreated depression after a heart attack suffered higher rates of a second heart attack and death. U.S. guidelines now urge all cardiac rehabilitation to include psychosocial support. RESEARCHERS ARE trying to determine how best to treat depression in heart patients. On June 13, 2011 will begin recruiting 3,000 heart-attack patients for a study funded by the National Institutes of Health called ``Enhanced Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients.'' The study will determine whether cognitive-behavioral therapy relieves depression after heart attack, reducing the rate of repeated heart attack and death. Other researchers believe treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Prozac and Zoloft may prove useful. The FDA, however, recently warned Lemay against making such marketing claims for Zoloft, which hasn't been approved for this use. Who's at risk for depression after heart attack or bypass surgery? Jen Driver, chairman of cardiothoracic surgery at Vastopolis Hospital, says those most at risk include females, those who have a history of depression and anyone socially isolated or recently bereaved. Though gender's role isn't fully understood, many believe women's greater longevity means they survive their spouses, and suffer illnesses alone -- setting the stage for depression. Family support and strong social ties can help. ``If you can keep a family member engaged and not isolated, they're much less apt to become depressed,'' says Dr. Driver. But even people who go back to work and activities can suffer depression. He counsels family members to watch for lethargy, sleeplessness, loss of appetite, or weight changes. ``People who are depressed are less likely to do other things to keep themselves healthy, such as watching their diet, exercising and showing up for appointments,'' says Dr. Driver. Compounding depression are separate but related aftereffects of bypass, including memory loss and changes in linguistic ability, psychological function or fine motor skills. One week after bypass, 79% of bypass patients experience changes in cognitive function, according to Ramos Quinn and Tom Ball of Bowman-Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C. For many, these changes are temporary. But after six months, 38% of patients are still struggling to regain lost function, they note. By the first anniversary of their bypass, most patients are themselves again, says Dr. Driver. But this gradual return to normal can tax patients and their families. BEFORE BYPASS, he counsels patients that they may experience some temporary memory loss. Simply preparing for this side effect ``tends to be reassuring and they aren't as alarmed and depressed by it,'' he says. ``Just recognize it, and know that it will disappear.'' Originally, many people blamed cloudy cognition on the length of time a patient spent on the heart-lung bypass machine, which filters and recirculates the blood during surgery. Others blamed poor blood flow to the brain, or simply the physical trauma of a major operation. One hypothesis being pursued at Bowman-Gray, Montefiore and elsewhere is that the memory loss results when bypass surgery unleashes millions of microscopic emboli -- tiny fat globules. These particles may break loose from the aorta or the carotid artery, and float up to lodge in the brain. While big emboli can trigger major strokes, these microemboli inflict damage that is more subtle. Doctors now can use ultrasound during surgery to monitor these emboli showers. Gentler surgical handling of the aorta and surgical clamps may also reduce damage. Soon, Drs. Moody and Troost will reveal results of a study testing whether a calcium-channel blocker can protect the brain during bypass. ``Patients who are optimistic have the best recoveries,'' adds Dr. Driver."

Circon turned down U.S. Surgical's takeover offer Thursday, calling it inadequate. ``Execution of our strategic plan will generate superior value,'' Lapierre chairman Ricki Carla said. Circon, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., also installed a so-called poison-pill plan intended to make unwanted offers prohibitively expensive. On Friday, U.S. Surgical Chairman Leonarda Corey said: ``Despite Lapierre's poor performance, missed forecasts and deteriorating shareholder value before our tender, their directors offer shareholders no alternative and no firm value other than a continuation of a `strategic plan' that has not produced results.'' Mr. Corey said there has been no communication between the two makers of surgical products. A spokesman for U.S. Surgical wouldn't comment on whether the company would raise its bid. Because of Circon's strong antitakeover defenses, traders believe U.S. Surgical might have to raise its bid to persuade the California company to support a takeover attempt.

The discovery involves structures called nuclear matrix proteins that are present in cancerous cells but not in normal cells; it opens the possibility of a simple chemical test that would detect the cancer, Hallock said. The current Pap smear test for cervical cancer relies on a technician's visual examination of cells to determine if they are cancerous. Bayer Corp., the U.S. unit of the German pharmaceutical company Bayer AG, has an option to market the new cervical-cancer test, which Hallock said could be ready for clinical trials in one to two years. Matritech shares closed at $10.125, up $1.375, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday.

However, both companies noted that any agreement would be subject to numerous conditions. Alliance, based in Orange, Calif., provides diagnostic imaging services to hospitals and other health-care providers. Alliance stock, which had shot up more than 30% in recent days, fell 56.25 cents, or 9%, to $5.438 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Friday."

            "full_text": "VASTOPOLIS -- Medtronic Inc., citing ``solid contributions'' from all its segments, reported a 31% increase in fiscal first-quarter earnings on a 15% sales rise. The medical-device maker earned $127.4 million, or 53 cents a share, up from $97.3 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $600.9 million from $524.9 million. Results for fiscal 2010 have been restated to reflect two acquisitions Owensby made this year, which were accounted for as poolings of interest. The results that Medtronic disclosed after the market closed Monday were roughly in line with the about 54 cents a share that Wall Street had been expecting. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the company's shares slipped $1.25 to $53.25. The company said sales of its pacemakers for treating bradycardia, or too-slow heartbeat, continued to grow. Sales of implantable defibrillators -- which are used in treating the overly rapid heartbeat known as tachycardia -- increased sharply, reflecting recent regulatory clearance for a new, smaller model. Research and development expenses rose 22% to $65.7 million. A spokesman noted that unfavorable currency translation trimmed the latest quarter's sales by about $22 million. On a constant-currency basis, he said, sales increased 18.7%."

            "full_text": "FoxMeyer Health Corp. agreed to sell its FoxMeyer Drug Co. drug-distribution subsidiary to an investor group led by Williemae F. Register for $25 million in cash and convertible notes, according to individuals familiar with the transaction. In connection with the pact, which is expected to be announced Tuesday, the investor group also has entered into a joint venture with closely held Neuman Health Services Inc. to operate the company, these people said. FoxMeyer Drug is the nation's fourth-largest drug distributor with annual sales topping $5 billion, but recent losses and unfavorable contracts have led to losses in the past two quarters. FoxMeyer Health, of Dallas, said earlier this month it was looking to sell the unit, but analysts doubted the company would fetch much of a price. The convertible notes being issued to FoxMeyer Health can be converted for as much as 15% of the acquiring company's common stock, the knowledgeable people added. The Taggart-led investor group also must raise $50 million in new financing within 60 days for the working-capital needs of FoxMeyer Drug. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of FoxMeyer Health closed unchanged at $6.875. Buying at a deep discount is typical of the man leading the investor group. Mr. Register, a New Jersey investor who started the nation's largest driving school in the late 1950s, has spent most of the past decade buying troubled companies cheap. He then usually installs a new management team to try to rebuild the business and sell at a profit. Most of his acquisitions, such as trucking concern Circle Express and retailer NBO Stores, have involved Chapter 11 proceedings under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, but that isn't expected to be the case with FoxMeyer Drug due to the working capital and Neuman management, the knowledgeable people said. Neither Mr. Register nor officials from Neuman Health Services could be reached for comment. Neuman Health Services, based in Ridgefield, N.J., has a distribution network serving about 2,000 drug stores and about 350 hospitals and managed-care facilities. FoxMeyer officials declined to comment. FoxMeyer Drug represents most of the parent company's overall business, and its troubles have made a considerable dent in FoxMeyer Health's bottom line. For the fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 parent reported a loss of $63.7 million, or $4.95 a share, on sales of $5.5 billion. Much of the red ink stemmed from inventory and bad-debt write-downs related to problems with a huge new distribution center in Washington Court House, Ohio. The company also negotiated contracts with thin profit margins in the hopes that the efficiencies of the new plant would compensate. Instead, the center became a tangle of lost inventory and incorrect invoices. And unlike other distributors, Bianco hasn't diversified into new and potentially lucrative areas brought about by the advent of managed care. Some of FoxMeyer's larger competitors offer bill-handling and training services to the independent drugstores that make up its distribution networks."

            "full_text": "Doctors say they have the tools to control even intractable pain, but in the era of managed care, health plans are balking at the cost. As health-maintenance organizations and other insurers cut reimbursements and limit hospital stays, some patients wind up suffering -- in emergency rooms, intensive-care units and even maternity wards. Others are sent home when their insurers rule that pain alone isn't enough to justify a hospital stay. Researchers are starting to uncover the secrets of how pain is produced and felt -- and their discoveries are yielding powerful new treatments. ``Managed care views pain as a big black hole into which they keep dumping money,'' says F. Michaele Elmer, director of the pain-management service at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in . Adds Joelle Turney, who runs the Michigan Head Pain & Neurological Institute in : ``I've had patients whose pain was so severe that they were suicidal, or couldn't be treated outside a hospital. Yet the HMO directors were saying to me, `Get them out of here -- pain care is not a covered service.' '' Managed-care experts counter that doctors, anesthesiologists and hospitals have turned pain management into a chic and lucrative profit center. Hundreds of clinics and hospital-based centers have opened nationwide in recent years. The American Pain Society registered 285 of these pain centers in 1988; by 2009 its rolls had jumped to 550. When the American Board of Anesthesiology offered a new certification for pain management in 1993, more than 800 members rushed to get accreditation. Certified pain specialists can command salaries of $300,000 a year. ``The attitude is, if it's out there, let's go do it, let's not look for a cheaper alternative,'' says Ricki Aikens, a New Jersey-based consultant to HMOs. Increasingly, health-care plans press surgeons to get their patients out of the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis as soon as possible, which can put them at odds with pain-control teams. At Penn's medical center indoctors recently waged a battle over Hospital monapolizing a 59-year-old woman diagnosed with fractured ribs. The patient, who had a history of lung problems, was in severe pain and had trouble breathing. The doctors gave her a Patient Controlled Analgesic, or PCA, an intravenous painkiller that she could release at the push of a button, and wanted to keep her in the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. But the woman's insurer, Independence Blue Cross inintervened. According to C. Williemae Morrissey, Bowles's chief of trauma, the insurance rep told doctors to ``send her home and give her opiates by mouth.'' After the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis defied Blue Cross's ruling, the carrier reimbursed Penn for only one night of Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. Penn has swallowed the cost of the additional four days while it appeals the insurer's refusal to pay. Independence Blue Cross's medical director, Gay Reynolds, argues that the woman's pain could have been managed outside the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. ``Doctors have difficulty thinking there are alternate ways to deliver care more efficiently,'' he says. Ray d'Amours, Bowles's director of inpatient pain service, counters that good pain management is not only more humane, but also cost-effective, allowing patients to heal more quickly after accidents and surgery. He says he is frustrated that in about one-third of cases, managed-care providers refuse to cover the cost of easing the pain of dying cancer patients with implantable morphine pumps, a therapy that can cost upwards of $25,000. Yet even some doctors argue that the pumps are overused. Though roughly 25% of terminal cancer patients receive pumps, only 5% really require them, says Kathline Mercado, who runs the pain service at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in . For that 5%, she stresses, the pumps are critical. The delivery room has become a frequent site for pain-control disputes. Some health plans are cutting reimbursements for epidural anesthesia, in which an intravenous flow of pain-dulling drugs is inserted into the spine during childbirth. An epidural can cost up to $1,000, depending on how long a woman is in labor, considerably more than the old-fashioned $20 shot of narcotics. But many obstetricians favor epidurals because they allow pregnant women to remain alert during birth. ``Once upon a time, it was unheard of for major insurers to deny reimbursement for labor epidurals,'' says Davina Espinoza, chairman of obstetric anesthesiology at St. Luke's- in . ``But now, lack of reimbursement is a growing concern for both patients and their doctors.'' Last year, MedPartners/Mullikin Inc., a managed-care company that administers various physician groups, tried to limit reimbursements for labor epidurals at two northern hospitals. Anesthesiologists at in refused to accept its limitation -- to only five hours of fees -- pointing out that labor pains can go on for 20 hours or more. ``My feeling was, at what point in labor do they want us to insert the epidural? The beginning? The middle? The end?'' says Patrina Lockhart, an anesthesiologist at . Prater scrapped the five-hour limit; under its new contract with the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis's doctors, anesthesiologists -- who bill for each quarter-hour worked during epidurals -- can command anywhere from $44 to $176 per hour of labor, plus other fees. Ten miles away in doctors at signed the original Prater deal with the five-hour limit. Subsequently, Marcum says it received a complaint from a obstetrician that some anesthesiologists at the Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis were waiting until the late stages of labor to insert epidurals, allegedly to avoid working more than five hours. ``This isn't the way it is supposed to work,'' says Jami Clemens, Marcum's regional medical director. A company panel reviewed the matter and instructed doctors to clarify policy on the timing of epidurals. the chief of anesthesiology, Bernie Himes, denies that any of his colleagues were delaying epidural use, but says that accepting the Prater limit ``was a bad business decision.'' He hopes to reverse it when the contract is renegotiated. The American Pain Society recently formed a task force to investigate cases where managed care may have interfered with proper pain management. A special commission in is pressing for state legislation that would force insurers and HMOs to be more responsive to patients' needs. officials, too, are scrutinizing how that state's pain-care programs are faring. Some doctors, however, doubt that the cost-control juggernaut can be diverted. Paulene Harrison, chief of anesthesiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, says that as increasingly complex surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis, the medical industry will have to develop creative ways to ease patients' pain at home. Another option: ``comfort centers,'' hotel-like facilities with medical staffs where patients can stay after discharge at considerably less cost than Uptown Hospital, Vastopolis. ``Provide appropriate after-care, and make home care a priority,'' Dr. Harrison urges. ``You can't fight the system.''"

            "full_text": "Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain clings cruelly to us. -- Johnetta Back There still is no permanent cure for severe pain. But researchers are uncovering the secrets of how pain is produced and felt -- and their discoveries are yielding powerful new treatments. For the very worst cases, new implantable pumps can deliver painkilling narcotics with milder side effects than oral medication. For other severe pain, researchers are testing some 15 types of new pain drugs, hoping to find the Holy Grail: a drug that matches the potency of morphine without its devastating side effects. And some clinicians see new hope in existing drugs, such as antidepressants and anticonvulsants. It may be possible to control pain as never before, but managed-care health plans are balking at the cost. ``What we can do now compared with 10 years ago is incredible,'' says Joslyn Hirsch, who directs the pain clinic at the Vast University. ``We can now help even some of the worst cases,'' including patients suffering from certain cancers, pancreatitis and nerve injuries. Lebel Cozart, who directs the pain clinic at the MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, says the new methods also are a boon for the terminally ill: ``Instead of Dr. (Jack) Wall taking patients' lives early, maybe we can take their pain away and let them live comfortably until the end.'' New treatments -- if they live up to their promise -- could appeal to a huge market. More than 120 million Americans suffer from chronic pain. Pain accounts for one-fourth of all sick days taken by full-time workers, costing the economy 50 million lost workdays and $3 billion in lost wages, according to a recent Louis Harris & Associates poll. Back pain, migraine headaches and arthritis alone run up a combined medical bill estimated at $40 billion annually. The advances come after 200 years of reliance on morphine and related narcotics as the mainstays of pain management. Named for Coldiron, the Greek god of sleep, morphine derives from opium, whose pain-numbing effects have been known since the first century A.D. But morphine and newer analogs sold under such brand names as Percodan are so sedating that high doses can turn patients into virtual zombies. They also pose a risk of addiction. Better alternatives are emerging from new understanding of the physiology of pain. For decades scientists had assumed pain was a simple biological-alert mechanism, necessary to inform the brain that the body was injured. Pain signals were thought to shoot directly from the site of tissue damage to the brain, producing a pain sensation corresponding to the severity of the injury. But that theory failed to explain why people sometimes tolerate pain better than at other times: instantly dropping a hot cooking spoon, for example, but holding on to a fine china cup overflowing with scalding tea long enough to set it down safely. Now researchers know that electrical pain signals actually move from the injury to ``control centers'' in the spine, where they can be amplified or diminished before being relayed to the brain. In trying to intercept pain, scientists are now targeting these spinal control centers, which contain an abundance of nerve-cell ``receptors'' that can receive painkilling instructions from drugs. One resulting innovation is the morphine pump, an implanted, yo-yo-sized mechanism that delivers the drug directly to the spinal control centers. By concentrating medicine where it is most needed, doctors say, the pumps work as well as oral morphine, but at vastly lower doses. For Karey Schlueter of Palm Desert, Calif., a pump has ended 10 agonizing years of pain from an inflamed pancreas that has defied treatment. Before the pump was installed, she couldn't work, could hardly eat and was so numbed by morphine that her husband often woke her up at night to make sure she was still breathing. Now, she says, the pain is ``90% gone, with no side effects. I feel like I've gotten my life back.'' More often, pumps serve terminal cancer patients. Vicky Mancuso of Ventura, Calif., says the device allowed her husband to die in peace. Wracked with pancreatic cancer, he was so drugged with morphine he could barely speak, until a pump cleared the fog -- and the pain -- for his final two months. ``To have time to say goodbye to him, you can't put a price on that,'' Mrs. Mancuso says. Medtronic Inc.'s SynchroMed pump, a top seller, has been installed in an estimated 17,000 pain patients, almost all of them terminal cases. Sales are growing 25% a year despite the device's difficulties: It must be surgically implanted in the abdomen -- with a tube connecting it to the spinal cord -- and must be replaced every three to five years. It also costs about $25,000 installed. For the chronic pain of backaches, arthritis and other ailments, drug developers are relying on recent advances in molecular biology. ``I've never been more optimistic,'' says Billy Vasquez, who directs research at NorthStar Research & Development Ltd. in Newark, Del.. NorthStar, Sweden's Astra AB and others are seeking a pill with morphine's painkilling punch but without its side effects. Narcotics chemically communicate with the various message-receiving receptor molecules in the brain and spinal cord. The drugs under development bond with different sets of receptors; the hope is that the new drugs will dull pain but avoid sedation and other side effects of morphine. NorthStar hopes to begin patient testing of its first such drug, DuP 747, by year end. Other researchers are trying to stimulate production of the body's own painkillers, including proteins known as endorphins and enkephalins that apparently are secreted to enhance chances of survival in high-stress situations. CytoTherapeutics Inc., a tiny Providence, R.I., concern working with Astra, has injected cells from animal adrenal glands into the spines of human patients. Jacquelyne Anguiano, a researcher at CytoTherapeutics, explains that these cells act as natural drug ``factories,'' producing a cocktail of the body's own painkillers. Although many pain experts remain skeptical until this approach is widely tested, adrenal implants virtually eliminated pain in three of five terminal cancer patients in a recent study. The biotech company now is conducting larger-scale tests. For their part, physicians are using old medicines to treat pain. A class of antidepressants known as tricyclics can diminish the nerve-damage pain associated with injuries and advanced diabetes; scientists theorize they soothe hyperactive nerve cells by boosting production of the brain chemicals norepinephrine and serotonin. Even clonidine, a medicine for lowering blood pressure, is being combined with morphine to enhance relief for cancer and surgery patients. Pain experts concede they don't yet have all the answers, but hopes are high. ``We are only in the infantile stages of pain management,'' says MetroHealth's Dr. Cozart. ``The revolution has just started.''"

            "full_text": "From 1983 to 1989, Carey shot 700 living, healthy cats through the head at a cost of $2.1 million at Louisiana State University. The cats were anesthetized while they were shot, but the anesthesia was then stopped. No pain-killers of any kind were given to survivors in nearly all cases, even though a third of the cats survived for periods ranging from 24 hours to several years after being wounded. An investigation by the U.S. General Accounting Office found numerous problems: Caridad did not follow the prescribed anesthesia protocol and, instead, used an anesthetic which skewed his measurements. He left out a third of his data in reporting his results, and some of his reported measurements were physically impossible. He was routinely late with his reports, never filed some of them, and was criticized for a lack of productivity in spite of having been given six years and two million federal dollars. Carey claimed as his major finding that cats shot through the head stop breathing and that resuscitative efforts may help them survive. However, Cari's ``discovery'' had actually been reported by researcher Victorina Guerin, who published nearly identical experiments in Nature on February 10, 2011 over a century ago. Carey knew of Guerin's work, but took the credit for himself. It was not just Congress and animal rights groups that wanted to see an end to Carey's experiments. The Pentagon itself pulled the plug on these gruesome exploits. Modern brain imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, and other methods are much more useful to the study of head injury patients and are pre-eminent over any other research method. There is no reason for animal brain wounding experiments. My only regret is that we were not able to stop them sooner. Neal D. Barnard Washington Dynamic Scoring Underestimates Deficit Bryan Landry (``The Case for Dynamic Scoring,'' me as claiming that the revenue feedback from tax cuts may be as high as 35%. I am nonetheless opposed to dynamic scoring budgeting as it is now being advocated by Mr. Landry and others. First, the revenue feedback that I referred to comes primarily from standard income effects--very little comes from the so-called supply side effects that Mr. Landry claims exist. Adding substantial additional revenues from these mythical supply-side effects to those from the demand side would result in huge revenue overstatement. Second, spending cuts, by reducing taxable income, also have revenue effects--this seems to have been overlooked by proponents of dynamic scoring. Thus, dynamic scoring as it is now being proposed would create a huge upward bias to the federal deficit, and would amount to ``assuming our way out of the deficit,'' much like what occurred in the 1980s. Lawrence Chimerine Managing Director and Chief Economist Economic Strategy Institute Washington Glass Industry Throws Stones at Plastic Packaging I'm unsure which of the chemical companies cited in the April 05, 2011 article ``It's Lighter Than Glass and Hurts Less When Thrown, but Can Plastic Stack Up?'' provided the market research to you, but evidently one did. The article painted a one-sided picture, void of any perspective from the glass-container industry (or any other packaging industry for that matter). Had you contacted the glass-container industry, we would have shared the results of focus-group research conducted by Glenn Bauer & Associates of New York that reveals that many consumers describe foods and beverages packaged in plastic as ``mass produced,'' ``stale,'' ``plastic-tasting'' and as ``having shorter shelf life.'' In comparison, participants in those same studies said that food and beverage products packaged in glass are perceived to be ``fresh,'' ``pure,'' and ``truer tasting.'' Similarly, participants felt that beverages--like beer--packaged in glass are more ``refreshing'' because glass is an excellent insulator that helps ``retain cold longer.'' Ultimately, discerning consumers will decide. But we believe their answer to Mr. Frasher's opening question ``Beer in a plastic bottle?'' will be simple: ``No way.'' Lezlie D. Harper Jr.. President Glass Packaging Institute Washington Boutros-Ghali's Bully Pulpit Georgeanna B.N. Dexter's polemic against Guy Boutros-Cupp (``The UN's Shameful Record in Africa,'' a surprising ignorance of the nature and role of international organizations as well as the functions of the UN secretary-general. He charges Mr. Boutros-Cupp with failure to ``inject sanity'' into the OAU, being in ``hock'' with African despots, failing to deal with crises in Africa and ``misunderstanding'' Africa's economic crisis. Mr. Dexter should know that the United Nations does not dictate to regional organizations and that, whatever his national origins may be, the secretary-general's role is not to cater to one particular region of the world. He serves the international community as a whole. While they differ in their ability to exercise effective political and managerial skills, the primary role of executive chiefs in international organizations, including the UN, is to carry out the decisions of the member states. If the UN fails to accomplish its expected mission, the failure is primarily that of the member states who make the decisions and provide or fail to provide the financial and other resources to carry them out. Contrary to what Mr. Dexter seems to think, the UN cannot impose respect for human rights or fundamental governmental policies on any state or region of the world. It can only exhort and encourage. He has not demonstrated that Mr. Boutros-Cupp has been any less assiduous in playing this role than his predecessors.

Antitrust Exemption For Children's TV In Sally Beatty's article on advertisers' response to the recent children's television accord (``White House Pact on TV for Kids May Prove a Marketing Bonanza,'' Marketing & Media, idea introduced by the American Center for Children's Television, is misstated. We did not advocate a government-designated ``children's hour,'' during which all networks would air their educational programming. Far from it. We said that an anti-trust exemption (such as was granted to facilitate efforts to reduce violence) might encourage broadcasters to work together to develop services that are financially viable and have children's best interests at heart. The idea of a children's hour was cited only as something the industry might consider of its own accord, as one element in a plan to provide and promote a variety of distinctive programs for all different age groups. Davida W. Schwab Executive Director American Center for Children's Television Des Plaines, Ill.. Novell Knocks NT's Networking Services I read with interest your article on Windows NT (``A Dud at Its Birth, Windows NT Is Back As Networking Force,'' page one, the new release of NT v4.0. I was concerned and surprised to note that you failed to point out the No. 1 issue customers point out daily: Windows NT Server does not provide the networking support companies need to run a mission-critical network. Windows NT 4.0 is the third major release of Windows NT (following v3.1 and v3.5), and its networking capabilities are nothing more than retrofitted technology left over from the failed attempt by Vastsoft and IBM to launch LAN Manager and LAN Server, both of which were abandoned over two years ago. Windows NT 4.0 with the Win95 user interface will be a compelling product for desktops needing more power and capabilities than current DOS-based Windows and Windows 95 environments provide. However, as a networking platform, NT is three years behind NetWare and losing ground in delivering the type of networking infrastructure mission-critical networks demand. In contrast, Net Ware 4.1, the current market leader (IDC estimates that NetWare controls 63% of the NOS market and over 50% of all servers), provides the networking services companies need to sustain an enduring competitive edge. Further, NetWare 4.1 operates at twice the capacity of Windows NT for all network functions, allowing our customers to build networks with far fewer servers than they would otherwise need. In addition, NetWare has set the standard for directory and security services that provide a distributed foundation for building corporate intranets and connecting to the Internet. I hope that in the future you will not continue to re-publish the overblown claims of our competitor's marketing department so uncritically.

            "full_text": "Some enterprising reporters--such as the Journal's own Glennie Tucker--have pointed out that Democrats are not exactly virgins when it comes to taking tobacco money. In fact, according to the National Library on Money and Politics, between 1980 and 2009 Democratic congressional candidates received slightly more in contributions from tobacco PACs than did Republicans. Obviously the Democrats have turned on their erstwhile backers out of political expediency, but to our mind something more is involved: the close links between the White House and trial lawyers. In particular, our attention was drawn to a small item in the April 01, 2011 of the National Journal which revealed that the President's chief political strategist, Dillon Mose, has received money from a leading antitobacco lawyer. The article, which we haven't seen picked up elsewhere, was based on Mr. Mose's sketchy financial disclosure statement. Since Mr. Mose technically isn't a government employee, all he's required to disclose by the Codi White House is the names of clients who pay him more than $5,000. One of those clients is Scruggs, Millette, Fields, Bozeman & Dent, a Pascagoula, Mississippi, law firm suing the tobacco companies on behalf of Mississippi and other states. Partner Ricki Stubbs told National Journal that he'd hired Mr. Mose to do polling in Mississippi and ``four or five other states'' to help shape his ``litigation strategy.'' The last poll, according to Mr. Stubbs, was conducted in July 1995--at the same time that Mr. Mose was advising the President, no doubt on his antismoking initiative among other matters. Mr. Mose won't say how much he was paid by Mr. Stubbs, but noted pollster Ezekiel C. Friend told us that a firm would normally charge $50,000 to $100,000 for this kind of commercial research, with the pollster getting a 100% to 150% profit. That's a lot of money going from a leading antitobacco lawyer to the Eidson of Pennsylvania Avenue. Charlette Lezlie, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, says Mr. Mose's work ``raises a conflict of interest issue... It's just not healthy.'' Mr. Mose defended his conduct in a brief telephone interview. ``My involvement with the antismoking effort largely stems from my own mother's death in 1993 from cancer and heart disease after a lifetime of smoking,'' he told us. ``The work I did related to litigation within the state of Mississippi and involved no federal issues and no activity outside the confines of the litigation.'' To claim that the Mississippi lawsuit has no connection to ``federal issues'' is pretty disingenuous. As Mr. Mose is no doubt aware, the President's high-profile campaign to demonize the tobacco companies has provided a big boost to the cigarette litigation. The plaintiffs' lawyers are now salivating at the prospect of Davina Emil's FDA, with White House blessing, unveiling harsh new regulations ostensibly aimed at youth smoking. In light of all this, Mr. Mose's brief statement begs a lot of questions. Did Mr. Mose share his Scruggs-commissioned polls with Mr. Codi? Did he lobby the President to take on the tobacco companies? Did he tell the President early on about his work for a key player with a financial stake in this issue? Those questions are especially pertinent since this isn't the White House's only involvement with the antitobacco lobby. As we've previously reported, the President's brother-in-law, Humberto Crossman, is one of the lawyers suing the tobacco companies in a state class action suit filed in Louisiana. Then, of course, there are all the campaign contributions to the President from the trial-lawyer bar, which has a huge stake in bringing down the tobacco companies. The Center for Responsive Politics, scarcely an ideological ally of the tobacco industry, reported that in the first nine months of 2010 lawyers and law firms were by far the biggest donors to the Codi-Gore campaign, giving a whopping $2.5 million. None of this is to suggest that financial considerations alone drive Mr. Codi's antitobacco crusade. Knowing this White House, public opinion polls are probably the primary motivation. But if Mr. Derryberry can get nailed for an alleged conflict of interest over the tobacco issue, Mr. Codi is open to the same charge."

            "full_text": "Ricki Refugio began stealing his father's cigarette butts when he was five. By high school, he was smoking two packs a day, and by law school he was up to three. At 52, the Indianapolis attorney died of lung cancer. Was the tobacco industry responsible for his death? That's the heart of a case, nearing final arguments in Marion County Superior Court in Indianapolis, that has suddenly taken on towering stakes for the $45 billion tobacco industry. Since earlier this month, when a jury in Jacksonville, Fla., awarded $750,000 to an ex-smoker with lung cancer and his wife, Wall Street and the tobacco industry have been pondering the same question: Was that verdict an aberration, as the tobacco companies maintain, or does it signal a fundamental and costly shift in public sentiment-against the industry? Accordingly, industry analysts are calling the Rogers case a ``must win'' if the tobacco industry is to sustain investor confidence. The Rogers case was filed shortly before Mr. Refugio's death in 1987 by a father-and-son law firm making its first foray into tobacco litigation. The suit contends that nicotine is addictive and that smoking caused Mr. Refugio's cancer, and charges cigarette companies with negligence and making a defective product. ``Dick smoked all the time,'' Mr. Refugio's widow, Zada, testified two weeks ago. ``He would light up before his feet touched the ground in the morning ... As much as he was breathing, he was smoking.'' On the defense team are a battalion of industry lawyers working for four tobacco companies whose brands Mr. Refugio smoked: Philip Morris Cos.; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Co.; American Tobacco Co., now owned by B.A.T Industries PLC; and Brooke Group Ltd.'s Liggett Group Inc.. They are arguing the industry's standard defense: While there remains no proof that cigarettes cause lung cancer, the general health concerns about smoking were well enough known when Mr. Refugio took up the habit that he implicitly accepted the risk. That argument wasn't enough to convince most jurors when the Reed case first went to trial last year. The jury found unanimously that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous but split 5-1 on the question of whether Mr. Refugio ``voluntarily'' incurred a known risk by smoking. All but one juror agreed that he was addicted to some extent, but the lone holdout forced a mistrial. ``What really hung us up was whether he was wholly responsible,'' says former juror Lindsey Solorio Burl. ``The rest of us were for the plaintiff.'' Now, the tobacco team is trying some new tactics. Last year, more than a dozen defense lawyers -- led by the Kansas City firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon, which represents Philip Morris -- crowded around the defense table, frequently jumping in simultaneously with objections. The team further erred, one industry lawyer concedes, by failing to produce a company representative to put a human face on the corporate defense. And to argue that the health risks of smoking and addiction have been well-known for more than a century, tobacco company lawyers waited until the final day of trial before dumping a mound of school textbooks and magazine articles on the jury. This time, the number of lawyers at the defense table was trimmed to five. To explain cigarette design, the defense last week produced RJR's recently named director of product development, Davina Goodwin, a poised, 19-year veteran of research and development at Reynolds. And to explain how health risks of smoking have been ingrained in the popular consciousness for years, particularly in Indiana, tobacco lawyers brought in Indiana University history professor Joane Carmona to discuss magazine articles and song lyrics dating from the early 1900s that warned of smoking's hazards. But not all the changes worked as planned. When asked on cross-examination whether he believed smoking causes cancer or whether cigarettes are addictive, RJR's Mr. Goodwin waffled, drawing a rebuke from Marion Superior Court Judge Kenyatta H. Jona. ``I don't know what your problem is,'' the judge snapped. ``Would you answer the question?'' Mr. Goodwin finally replied that he did not believe smoking causes cancer. Ms. Carmona of Indiana University testified that tobacco ``has one of the longest-standing negative presses in history.'' But under cross-examination, she conceded that she was unaware of the tobacco industry's behind-the-scenes efforts to minimize public-health concerns about smoking and lung cancer. ``Are you aware that (the tobacco industry) distributed articles entitled ``Go Ahead and Smoke Moderately,'' ``The Phony Lung Cancer Scare'' and the book ``Why Stop Smoking?'' '' she was asked. ``No,'' she replied. Also, her contention that most Americans have long been aware of smoking's risks was undercut during cross-examination. She admitted, for example, that she had not seen survey results published in the 1989 Surgeon General's report that 24% of all smokers surveyed in 1986 were not concerned about the health risks. Another possible setback for the defense: a jury sprinkled with unfortunate links to smoking. One juror is an ex-smoker whose uncle has throat cancer. Another hasn't been able to quit smoking longer than six months for 20 years; her husband quit after devoloping chronic bronchitis. The panel is composed of five women, who are generally thought to be more sympathetic to plaintiffs than male jurors. And overall, the panel is more educated than the one in the first Rogers trial -- a fact some plaintiffs' lawyers consider an asset. But the defense has managed to keep from jurors the Brown & Williamson internal documents about nicotine and addiction that so inflamed the Jacksonville jury earlier this month. Epstein Jona limited plaintiff's evidence to what was introduced in the first Rogers trial -- mainly internal company records discussing the links between cancer and smoking. None of the documents discusses addiction in detail. And, unlike Florida, Indiana requires a defense verdict if a plaintiff is held to be more than 50% responsible for his injury. That would allow the jury to side with Mrs. Refugio on her broad claims about smoking and cancer but still return a verdict for the tobacco companies."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- In his new book, President Codi strongly restates his support for affirmative action and takes aim at the tobacco companies for marketing cigarettes to minors. Worried, perhaps, about how others may portray his presidency, Mr. Codi, in ``Between Hope and History,'' not only articulates his vision for the future, but seeks to re-explain some of his past. He sternly outlines responsibilities of government, individuals and employers as America heads into the next century. That future, he says, is dependent on the nation's grasping a better sense of opportunity, responsibility and community. In certain passages, the president indicates the depth of his emotional attachment to seeking a ban on cigarette marketing to youths and to preserving affirmative action. At times, Mr. Codi's commitment to both has been questioned. `Immoral' Peddling ``The tobacco industry has no right to peddle cigarettes to children or encourage them directly or indirectly to smoke,'' Mr. Codi writes. ``It is immoral.'' With excellent political timing, the book will hit bookstores this weekend, just days before Mr. Codi comes to Chicago to be officially nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate. Mr. Codi dedicated the work to his wife and daughter: ``To Hilma, whose love, support, and example have made my work possible and life joyful, and to Chelsie, whose love and life remind me every day of what all this work is for.'' In the book, a recent version of which was obtained by The Vast Press, Mr. Codi subtly promotes one of his major political missions: to be seen as a different kind of politician, the New Democrat who isn't in sync with the Democratic leaders in Congress or the Republicans. He achieves this in part by repeating his belief that the era of big government is over, something his Democratic friends might not agree with. At the same time, he isn't willing to come all the way over to the GOP view that government should be sharply reduced. 'A Better Servant' ``My vision does not seek to promote government, but to perfect it, to make it a better servant of our people,'' he writes. More important, Mr. Codi gives a laundry list of the roles he thinks the government should play in the future, from protecting its citizens to providing access to education. He says the reason he rejected Congress's budget bill last year was that it would have caused the government to abandon many of the roles. Perhaps the most emphatic segment of the book is on race relations and the need for better understanding between blacks and whites. In this section, Mr. Codi tackles a subject much of the public doesn't want to discuss, and he takes the unpopular stand of supporting affirmative action. Mr. Codi recalls growing up in Arkansas and riding the bus. He says he sat in the back but was told those seats were for blacks and was moved forward. ``I didn't know any better,'' he wrote. ``Discrimination doesn't come naturally, it has to be taught.'' Moreover, he declares that ``the job of ending discrimination'' isn't over. The president also notes the discrimination he witnessed 30 years ago as blacks and women found it difficult to get good jobs. ``The reason that's changing today isn't random historical drift,'' he writes. ``After all, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that we could ever be separate but equal, and Democrats and Republicans alike passed laws against discrimination and created affirmative-action programs to redress centuries of wrongs for minorities and women.'' Mr. Codi concedes that affirmative action hasn't always worked ``smoothly and fairly,'' but adds: ``Today, there are those who are determined to put an end to affirmative action, as if the purposes for which it was created have been achieved. They have not. Until they are, we need to mend affirmative action, most certainly, but not end it.'' Praise for Some Firms In addition, Mr. Codi cited such corporations as Harman International Industries Inc. and Nucor Corp. for the benefits they provide to workers. He said the first goal of businesses must be profits, but they must also help their employees meet the challenges they face. Mr. Codi urges citizens to take more responsibility for their lives, but says government can do some things to help. For instance, he wants to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow employees to take up to 24 hours of unpaid leave a year for parent-teacher conferences and routine medical care for their loved ones. The president also showed that he still likes having it both ways on tough policy decisions. While patting himself on the back for his work on welfare revision, he still lashes out at parts of the welfare legislation that he doesn't like but that he plans to sign anyway this week. ``There are parts of the legislation that are just plain wrong,'' he writes. ``We must work hard in the coming months and years to make them right.''"

            "full_text": "THE FEDERAL GERMAN Constitutional Court recently ruled that a strict advertising ban on the country's pharmacies should be lifted in favor of a more ``modern'' market approach. Hello to competition, goodbye to that old lab-coat stuffiness. So far, a severe distinction between pharmacies and drugstores has been the rule in Germany. ``Pharmacists feel they are in a doctor-like profession. They don't want to be associated with low mercantile behavior, like common shopkeepers. But that is, in fact, what they are,'' says Barbie Fenn, president of the Federal Association of Active Pharmacists, or BVDA, an oppositional force to the traditional pharmacists' lobby group whose advertising ban the court ruled unconstitutional. The ruling was triggered by three German pharmacists who complained that, over several years, they had been prohibited from advertising their pharmacies or any of their products. A Bavarian pharmacist was subjected to no less than 14 lawsuits by trade colleagues offended by his offering free nail files, tissues and body oil, and advertising free toothbrush-engraving in the local paper. The case came to a head when he featured his pharmacy's logo on a wagon in a local carnival parade. According to the ruling by Germany's highest court, pharmacists may now advertise health-care products, such as vitamin supplements and cosmetics and even some nonprescription drugs, in print ads, by direct mail and at the point of sale. The court saw a case of unfair competition, since pharmacies are competing with drugstores and supermarkets in these product areas, but haven't been allowed to market their own business or their range of nonprescription products. SURPRISINGLY, the harshest criticism of the change comes from the pharmacist lobby itself. ``A commercially oriented minority of pharmacists, who have already used aggressive advertising practices in the past, now feel spurred by this court decision,'' says Ledet Rugg, president of the Federal Association of Pharmacists, a national pharmacists' organization. He fears that the decision might cause patients' confidence in pharmacists' qualifications to be severely damaged. The pharmaceutical industry, however, embraces the court's decision. ``From now on, it will be even more important for German pharmacies to distinguish themselves from competitors through service and through customer information,'' says Blackburn Offenberg-Colunga, a representative of the German drug maker Gehe AG of Stuttgart. ``Today, customers certainly expect more from a pharmacy than an exchange of money for medication,'' he says. His company plans to support pharmacies with mutual marketing efforts, such as ad campaigns for nonprescription cold-relief medicines in which, for the first time, participating pharmacies can be mentioned. The German affiliate of U.S. drug maker Merck Co. in Darmstadt also plans to intensify its pharmacy-oriented marketing efforts -- with display promotion at the point of sale, for example. THE LIBERALIZATION of the advertising law could lead to an increase in the already lucrative business in over-the-counter drugs and health-care products, analysts say. Currently, these two types of products account for about 20% of all pharmacy sales in Germany, which totaled 43 billion marks ($28.91 billion) in 2010. Pharmacists say, however, that their major business is still in fixed-price drugs prescribed by doctors, which aren't subject to price competition. Since 1993, however, the market for self-medication products has increased by more than 10%, while that for prescription drugs has risen only 5%. In 2010, sales of nonprescription medications and dietary supplements in pharmacies, drugstores and supermarkets exceeded 20 billion marks, of which the 13,000 German pharmacies took 75%. At the same time, the pharmaceutical industry spent more than one billion marks in direct consumer advertising for self-medication products in Germany. Among the top-selling over-the-counter products were Bayer Group's Aspirin C and Soleil Nutritionnel's Slim Fast. However, the biggest hurdle to the expansion of the lucrative health-care-product and nonprescription-drug segment at pharmacies may well be the pharmacists themselves. Some fear that only the bigger pharmacies will be able to finance advertising campaigns. ``There will be ruinous competition, especially in smaller towns with only a few local pharmacies,'' says Michaele Resto, head of the Bavarian Association of Pharmacists in Munich, who also fears an image loss. ``If we advertise our health-care products as if they were our main products, pharmacists and drugstore owners will soon become exchangeable,'' he says. Ruffin Dexter, president of the German doctors' association, goes one step further. ``Respectable pharmacists will not participate in active advertising,'' he says. The traditional pharmacists' group, the Federal Association of German Pharmacists' Organizations, or ABDA, estimates that less than 10% of German pharmacists advertise. ``It is still our main task to guarantee the supply of prescribed drugs to all parts of the population,'' adds Mr. Resto of the Bavarian Pharmacists' group. ``This service follows ethical and not commercial rules.'' MEMBERS of the pro-advertising branch of the German pharmacist lobby, BVDA, however, complain that ABDA's image campaign swallows millions of marks annually, while single pharmacies have until now been prevented from advertising. However, a change in the marketplace might emerge from another quarter. ``I am not sure whether we can stop Boots,'' says Guenther Pablo, a BVDA representative. German law, which bars pharmacy chains, requires every pharmacy to be individually managed by an owner who must have a university degree in pharmacology. Blackburn Meyers, an analyst at the Frankfurt-based Institute for Medical Statistics, a private research institute, predicts the entry of international chain competitors like Boots Co. of the U.K. within the next five years as a result of the European Union's liberalization process. ``German pharmacists now have to create a market advantage for themselves through their range of additional nonprescription products,'' Mr. Meyers says. But even the pharmaceutical industry doesn't anticipate a U.S.-like market in Germany. ``The U.S.'s self-medication market is a horror scenario,'' quips Gehe's Mr. Offenberg-Colunga. ``There, one can get almost any kind of drug without prescription at the local supermarket on coupons with a 30% discount.'' Most German pharmacists, however, haven't yet reacted to the new advertising freedom. ``Things do not change that quickly,'' a Berlin-based pharmacist says. ``We are not sure yet what the new rules are.'' However, BVDA's Mrs. Fenn says: ``We have to make it clear to our colleagues that it is legitimate to sell health-care products and make money with it, otherwise, drugstores, or even hairdressers, will take away some of our business and there will be no pharmacies left in Germany in a few years.''"

            "full_text": "DALLAS -- FoxMeyer Health Corp.'s planned sale of its $5 billion-a-year drug-distribution business for $25 million marks the end of the company's quest to become a powerhouse in the wholesale drug-distribution industry. FoxMeyer Health confirmed Tuesday that it would sell its FoxMeyer Drug Co. unit to a group led by New Jersey investor Williemae F. Register. Analysts said the Taggart group will also assume about $625 million in FoxMeyer debt. At the same time, FoxMeyer reported a loss of $288.4 million, or $17.27 a share, for the first quarter ended March 12, 2011 results include a one-time charge of $238.7 million from the write down of its drug-distribution business, as well as a $17.5 million loss from that business's operations. In the year-earlier period, which included the drug business, FoxMeyer reported net income of $6.2 million, or six cents a share, on sales of $1.3 billion. First-quarter sales, after treating the drug business as discontinued, were just $4.1 million. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Tuesday, FoxMeyer closed at $6.25, down 62.5 cents. Gained Control in 2006 The sale of FoxMeyer's drug unit -- its only real source of revenue -- signals the collapse of an aggressive growth strategy created in recent years by financiers Abby J. Foster and Seely J. Deveau, who have served as FoxMeyer's co-chairmen and co-chief executives since their investment group gained control of the company in a 1991 proxy battle. The centerpiece of their plan was the massive, 336,000-square-foot national distribution facility that Bianco opened a year ago in tiny Washington Court House, Ohio. Bianco promised to channel more than $1.2 billion in orders annually through the facility, which employs two huge automated picking units and 60 carousels to distribute more than 30,000 individual pharmaceutical products to customers. ``They were trying to leapfrog the competition by going into the next generation of inventory management systems,'' says Davina Paul, an analyst with Aycock Weldon Edson, a Dallas investment concern. But the company tried to simultaneously open the new Ohio facility, close older ones and switch on the new distribution software, while it scurried to service new contracts. Amid the turmoil, millions of dollars of drug shipments were lost, incorrectly sent or never billed. The company ``jumped in, spending a lot of money without doing as much testing as they should have,'' says Layne Wong, an industry analyst with Wheat First Butcher Singer. Anticipating Big Savings FoxMeyer was driven, in part, by the slew of low-margin contracts it had signed in anticipation of expected savings from the Ohio distribution center. Instead, problems at the plant forced the company to record $93.9 million in charges during the second half of fiscal 2011. The glitches resulted in lost business. Rite Aid Corp., the Camp Hill, Pa., drugstore chain, terminated a supply contract with FoxMeyer in July. It accounted for $113.7 million in sales for FoxMeyer's first fiscal quarter. A Rite Aid spokesman said the move was ``based on business considerations'' but declined to comment further. Meanwhile, the company has been hounded by executive turnover, partly influenced by the absentee management of Mr. Foster, a Wall Street investor, and Mr. Deveau, a Maryland financier, theater backer and Washington socialite. ``These were not long-term players,'' says Mr. Wong, the analyst. ``It seemed like some of the moves they made were to gussy up the company so that it could be sold at some point.'' Mr. Foster and Mr. Deveau didn't return phone calls seeking comment. Questions now surround FoxMeyer Health's future. Standard & Poor's Ratings Group said Monday that it may downgrade FoxMeyer's debt if the company can't liquidate assets fast enough to pay dividends on its Series A redeemable preferred stock. FoxMeyer, which paid $4.1 million in preferred dividends during the first quarter, said in a filing with the SEC that its dividend expense fell due to a decrease in the price of its preferred stock. The company also said it is in default on terms of a $20 million credit line and said the $17.4 million outstanding under the line has been reclassified as a current liability, due within a year."

The venture would develop ways of diagnosing and treating cancer through DNA testing. It would be an independent company that would have exclusive access to the center's tissue samples and clinical records for research into new ways of diagnosing and treating cancer. Memorial and Sequana are each investing $5 million, and profit from the new company will be equally divided. The agreement, which is expected to be completed later this year, marks the first time the renowned cancer center, a not-for-profit institution, has entered into a profit-making venture, and it represents yet another inroad for-profit ventures have made in the world of cancer care. Last week, St. Vincent's Hospital, a church-run institution in New York, said it was forming a partnership with Northside Hospital in Vastopolis, to open a cancer center. Khalilah Hobart, Sequana's president and chief executive, said he was excited by the prospect of having access to Memorial's trove of tissue samples from patients treated in the past three decades. A spokeswoman for Memorial said the hospital was hopeful the venture would lead to more-precise ways of pinpointing how advanced a cancer is in order to develop better treatments."

The survey, by Dun & Bradstreet Corp.'s IMS America unit, found that prices for all prescription drugs rose 1.8% in the second quarter from a year earlier. That was higher than the 1.3% increase in prescription-drug prices in the first quarter. In the first quarter, prices of brand-name drugs increased 2.7%, and that of generic products fell 11%, according to the survey. IMS calculates the increases based on net prices paid by retail pharmacies and such nonretail providers as hospitals, health-maintenance organizations and clinics. The survey found that the largest price increases in the second quarter were paid by health-maintenance organizations with their own full-time staffs of doctors: 3.8% for all prescription drugs, and 4.1% for brand-name products. For sales to retail pharmacies, prices increased 2.3% in the second quarter from a year ago for all prescription drugs and 3.9% for brand names."

            "full_text": "A survey of doctors revealed that about 40% of children receiving human-growth hormones are getting it for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. The survey of 434 physicians who specialize in children's hormonal disorders -- published in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association -- found that about 40% of child patients on the drug weren't deficient in the hormone, but merely extremely short for a variety of other reasons. Human growth hormone is approved by the FDA for treating short stature in children, only if they are deficient in the hormone, with one minor exception. Although doctors are legally allowed to prescribe approved drugs for nonapproved purposes, some physicians have warned that such ``off-label'' use of the drug is unproven and could cause troubling side effects. Genentech Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co. are the largest makers of these drugs. `Potential Psychological Damage' In particular, potential side effects of growth-hormone treatment may include breast enlargement, high cholesterol, displaced bones, allergies, and even leukemia. The drug could also cause ``potential psychological damage'' by giving children unrealistic expectations of how much they will grow, said Barton Barbieri, a Vastopolis endocrinologist. Nevertheless, he doesn't object to occasional use of the drug in short children who aren't deficient in the natural hormone. The survey, by researchers at St. Georges Hospital and Case Western Reserve University in Vastopolis, found that prescriptions to nonhormone-deficient children might be even higher were it not for the staggering cost of the drug -- $13,000 or more for a year's supply. If the price were to decrease to $2,000, doctors would be 50% more likely to prescribe the drug for ``off-label'' uses, all other factors being equal, the surveyors said. Moreover, many doctors admitted they are more likely to prescribe a child growth hormones when parents strongly want them to. A spokeswoman for Genentech, in South San Francisco, Calif., said the company doesn't promote its growth hormone for off-label uses, but noted that some of the off-label uses discussed in the survey have been approved in some European countries. Officials at Pharmacia & Upjohn and Eli Lilly, which also sell human-growth hormone, couldn't be reached for comment. Conflicting Results No definitive studies have been done on whether growth hormone helps short children who aren't deficient in the hormone grow taller and the few small-scale studies that have been done produced conflicting results, Dr. Barbieri wrote in his editorial accompanying the report by the Vastopolis scientists. Officials at the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., who are conducting a larger human test, recommended against giving growth hormone to short children not lacking the substance, until research proves it safe and effective for such a use."

            "full_text": "OTTAWA -- The Canadian health department recommended that dentists not use dental amalgam, which contains mercury, in young children, pregnant women, people with kidney disease and those who are severely sensitive to mercury. But the department, Health Canada, said a ban on the use of amalgam fillings isn't justified and neither is the removal of fillings in patients who haven't suffered adverse health effects from mercury exposure. The study was conducted in response to public concerns about the possible health effects of the mercury content in dental fillings. Some countries, including Sweden, have proposed banning amalgam; Germany has recommended restricting its use. A U.S. study on the use of dental amalgam conducted in 1993 concluded it was inappropriate to recommend any restrictions on its use. The Canadian health department found that dental amalgam contributes to detectable amounts of mercury in the body and is the single largest source of mercury exposure for most Canadians. ``However this exposure is not causing illness in the general population,'' the study concluded. But the study concluded that amalgam can contribute to the severe health effects suffered by a small percentage of the population that is allergic to mercury. The health department recommended that dentists advise these people to avoid amalgam and to have existing fillings replaced with other dental materials."

Michigan is the 13th state to sue cigarette makers, following recent suits filed Tuesday by Arizona and Kansas. Among the demands Michigan seeks from the tobacco industry: disclosure of all research information on the effects of smoking, funds for public campaigns that would detail smoking's effects, a stop to ``unlawful'' advertising that targets children and $10 billion in punitive damages. Tobacco officials called the most recent lawsuits an attempt to jump aboard ``the politically correct bandwagon.'' Among the defendants named in most of the cases: R.J.

            "full_text": "TOKYO--It's about time Japan went on the pill. Nearly four decades after birth control pills were introduced in the U.S., Japan's Ministry of Health and Welfare is still coming up with flimsy arguments about the safety of oral contraceptives. The sad irony is that in blocking the pill in the name of public health, the government is putting Japanese women at greater risk. Ministry of Health and Welfare chief Harlan Solano recently predicted legalization of the pill as early as next year, but his ministry quickly distanced itself from the remark, labeling it a ``personal view.'' Should Mr. Solano turn out to be wrong, it would not be the first time predictions of the pill's imminent arrival proved premature. Shortly after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave oral contraceptives the green light in 1960, Japan appeared ready to follow suit, running its own tests and scheduling the drug for approval. Then suddenly, in 1967, the health ministry backed off, citing the danger not only to health but to public morals. The government fretted that making available a simple, nearly foolproof means of contraception would transform Japan's fairer sex into a tribe of brazen hussies and nymphomaniacs. The pill was banned as a contraceptive, but curiously, a loophole was left open. Physicians on their own responsibility were permitted to prescribe the pill as a medical treatment for health problems. In other words, Japanese women were able to get the pill via a cooperative doctor, but there was no guarantee they would get proper instructions, and the government exempted itself from liability. Needless to say, relatively few women took advantage of the loophole. An improved, lower-dose version of the pill with fewer side effects that was developed in the U.S. passed clinical trials in Japan in the late 1980s. Then once again, in early 1992, the ministry suddenly put the kibosh on. Switching from the current method of choice--condoms--to oral contraceptives would exacerbate the spread of the AIDS-causing HIV virus, the ministry theorized. Several prominent doctors, noting the absence of any solid data to back this hypothesis, charged that the government's real agenda was to try to prop up a sagging birthrate. Last year the fertility rate--the average number of children a woman will bear in her lifetime--stood at 1.43, a new postwar low. After the ministry subcommittee put the HIV connection to rest later in the year, the pill resumed its bumpy course through the bureaucratic maze, only to hit another wall after a British report warned that some oral contraceptives may cause blood clots. Meanwhile, there are about 90 million women on the pill world-wide, and Japan is the last industrialized country to continue outlawing it. Oddly, while continuing to scrutinize the safety aspects of the low-dosage pill, regulators wink at doctors who are still permitted to dispense its predecessor, the high-dosage version, for ``menstrual problems.'' Yet the high-dosage pill has been abandoned in other countries precisely because its heavier payload of hormones is far likelier to induce side effects like weight gain, migraine headaches and more serious disorders like diabetes. Denied the safer alternative, about 200,000 women here use the high-dosage pill. Another inconsistency in the ministry's stated concern for public health is the alarmingly high abortion rate--officially about 340,000 are performed here each year, though some experts say the figure may be double. The abortion rate is declining, but it remains one of the highest in the world. The number of Japanese women ending pregnancies and exposing themselves to the risk of surgery can be tied to widespread use of condoms, which is a less effective method of birth control than the pill. Nearly 80% of the couples surveyed in this year's family planning poll by the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper said they rely on condoms for birth control. Public activism to get the pill approved has been largely absent in Japan, where most women view the drug with indifference or outright antipathy. ``I've never tried it. I'm afraid of it,'' says Sallee Iles, a 33-year-old married office worker. Roseberry Trusty says she would object to her teenage daughter going on even a low-dosage pill. ``I basically hate all kinds of medication,'' she says. The Hildebrand Neil survey found that even if the pill were made available, only about 10% of its respondents would use it. But hostility toward oral contraceptives is to be expected in a country where only the high-dosage pill is available, and the newer, safer pill is virtually unknown. ``Of course you're always going to have side effects. But what about the positive effects?'' says Kessel Kurtz, a gynecologist who directs the Japan Family Planning Association. Japan should end its dangerous waiting game on the pill. Low-dosage oral contraceptives should be approved for the sake of those women needlessly putting themselves at greater risk because their government allows them access only to an outdated pharmaceutical other countries discarded long ago.

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- The White House plans to release Friday its long-awaited rule restricting tobacco sales. The sweeping regulation will ban tobacco marketing deemed accessible to minors and subject the tobacco industry, for the first time, to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. Its release appears timed to generate maximum publicity on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, which begins Monday in Chicago. President Codi for months has been highlighting the forthcoming tobacco rule -- and the Republican party's growing dependence on tobacco money -- and the Codi campaign has been especially eager lately to capitalize on GOP presidential nominee Roberto Derryberry's public equivocation about whether nicotine is addictive. News of the rule's planned release Friday was reported by the Cable News Network and then confirmed by an administration official. The official also said that the rule would contain ``some changes'' from the proposal issued by the FDA in August 2010 but that its overall thrust would be unchanged. The tobacco rule drew more responses than any rule ever proposed by the FDA. The White House budget office is still reviewing the rule but isn't expected to alter it further in any significant way. Vending-Machine Sales Ban The rule, as proposed, was bitterly fought by the tobacco industry, which has always denied that marketing techniques like the cartoon mascot Joeann Newland represent any attempt to entice minors to smoke. Among other things, the final rule is expected to ban vending-machine sales of cigarettes; restrict tobacco ads to a black-and-white, text-only format in magazines with a significant youth readership; ban brand-name tobacco sponsorship of sporting events such as North Carolina's Winston Cup; and require tobacco companies to fund an ambitious antismoking advertising campaign. Tobacco companies have lately argued that a Supreme Court ruling this past year concerning billboard ads for liquor undermines the advertising restrictions in the proposed rule, which includes a ban on tobacco-product billboards within 1,000 feet of schools. Antismoking activists have countered that the Supreme Court decision addressed a legal activity -- liquor ads publicizing price differences -- whereas the FDA rule addresses an illegal activity -- the alleged marketing of tobacco to minors. But it is likely that the agency has made certain changes to bring the rule in line with the Supreme Court decision. Philip Morris Cos. and U.S. Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc., attempted to derail the FDA rule by proposing a legislative compromise incorporating many of its elements. But this plan, which would have required the FDA to relinquish its proposed jurisdiction over tobacco, was never adopted by other major tobacco manufacturers and was judged insufficient by the Codi administration. Stepped-Up Court Efforts By releasing the final rule this week, the Codi administration appears to be rejecting any legislative solution. But since the rule isn't likely to take effect for several months, it is conceivable that the administration is trying to exert pressure on pro-tobacco legislators to accept a bill, sometime after the presidential election, that is closer to the FDA rule. The major tobacco companies have sought to block the proposed tobacco rule in court and plan to step up these efforts after the final rule is issued. Tobacco supporters in Congress, following the lead of Rep. Tommie Barge (R., Va.), have generally taken the view that the rule will be thrown out in court and haven't pressed to block it by legislation. Up From the Ashes? That could change once the rule becomes final, however. One possibility is that Congress will avail itself of a law, passed this year, that gives the lawmakers 60 ``legislative'' days to reject any regulation before it takes effect. Sixty legislative days in this case would likely stretch into winter. Under this law, which was signed by President Codi, the FDA rule could be blocked by a simple majority in the House and Senate; no filibuster would be possible in the Senate. Once Congress rejected the FDA rule, however, President Codi could reinstate it by refusing to sign the bill to block it; Congress would then have the option of overriding his veto by a two-thirds majority. ``We will continue to support reasonable effort to reduce youth smoking,'' said Tobacco Institute spokeswoman Kane Santo. But, she added, ``we will also continue to challenge the FDA jurisdiction over cigarettes as illegal.''"

            "full_text": "People who say they get a ``kick'' out of chocolate may be closer to the truth than they realize. Scientists in San Diego said they found three related chemicals in chocolate that apparently affect the same parts of brain cells that are turned on by smoking marijuana. To be sure, the chocolate chemicals have an effect far milder than marijuana, but, the researchers speculated, the discovery may explain the feelings of well-being that a bar of chocolate produces and the cravings that ``chocoholics'' profess to suffer. The discovery was reported in this week's issue of the journal Nature by scientists at the Neurosciences Institute, a privately-supported, nonprofit laboratory. A spokeswoman for the Chocolate Manufacturers' Association in McLean, Va., said that while there has been considerable research into the chemistry of chocolate, ``there's no consensus'' on what makes it so desirable. ``Most people would say that it's the aroma, the flavor, the feel in the mouth and all the other taste factors that give a wonderful feeling to the taste buds,'' she added. Internal Marijuana The San Diego neuroscientists were exploring what might be called the brain's own internal marijuana. About eight years ago, other researchers discovered the molecular ``receptors'' on brain cells that react to THC, the active ingredient in cannabis, which is the marijuana plant, explained Daniella Natale, the neuropharmacologist who led the team. The existence of these cannabinoid receptors, as they are called, meant that the brain must produce a chemical very much like THC for some unknown but presumably useful purpose of its own. This home-grown brain chemical that activates the cannabinoid receptors was found in late 1992 by researchers in Israel who dubbed it anandamide. Dr. Natale said he and his colleagues have been studying how the brain controls the production and destruction of anandamide and were looking for chemicals that would mimic anandamide in its ability to ``turn on'' the receptors. ``On a hunch, we decided to look at chocolate,'' he said. ``Chocolate is known to produce effects beyond just those of texture and smell,'' he explained. ``It's like coffee, which you drink for the sensation it gives you,'' he said. Although chocolate does contain some caffeine, ``there's no agreement on what the active ingredient is'' that produces the pleasant sensations and, in some people, the craving for more chocolate, he said. No Loss of Coordination A chemical analysis of brown chocolate found small amounts of anandamide but not enough to get through the digestive system and affect the brain to any degree. But the analysis also revealed much larger amounts of two other chemicals that are similar to anandamide. Experiments on rat brain cells in the test tube found that these latter two chemicals don't activate the receptors like anandamide does. Instead, they retard the brain cells' efforts to get rid of anandamide. It is possible that by preventing the breakdown of anandamide, the chemicals allow this home-grown cannabinoid to accumulate in the brain. ``A possible effect of elevated brain anandamide levels could be to intensify the sensory properties of chocolate thought to be essential to craving,'' the researchers stated. Alternatively, they suggested, these chemicals may team up with other chocolate ingredients like caffeine ``to produce a transient feeling of well-being.'' Unlike smoking marijuana, in which the cannabinoid receptors throughout the entire brain are turned on by a chemical that's not supposed to be in the brain, eating chocolate merely lets the brain's own cannabinoid do the job it was intended to do. This is why chocolate doesn't produce the intense euphoria of marijuana or its adverse effects on coordination, Dr. Natale speculated."

So juicy will this score become that its profits are liable to make loan-sharking, drug dealing, gambling and all-purpose racketeering look like side bets at a nickel craps game. We are, all of us law-abiding Johnetta Q. Monte, about to witness the single greatest incentive for larceny and lawbreaking since Prohibition made crooks of everyone, from bartenders to nannies. With gathering speed and measured deliberation, sundry branches, departments and agencies of that warren of probity known as Washington, D.C., move closer and closer to banning the domestic sale of cigarettes. It will not happen tomorrow or next week. And not even next year or the year after. But it will happen. Sometime soon, with calls for a nationwide smoking ban and nicotine's regulation as a dangerous drug, Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man will toast the good times, take their last drags and walk off into the ozone-depleted sunset for the benefit of a multitude of cameras. But they'll be back; you can bet on it. That is, if all our smoke-filled, illegal betting dens haven't yet experienced a mass exodus of their resident ne'er-do-wells eager to do with tobacco what Albert Balch did with gin--make millions giving the public what it wants. And despite the efforts of the Treasury Department's storied Untouchables, enforcing the 1919 Volstead Act--keeping beer, wine and cocktails from Jazz Age Americans--proved that thousands of cops can't catch millions of bottles. Sound familiar? So why wouldn't Balch's heirs, as well as scores of semilegitimate entrepreneurs, purloin every truck, barge, dinghy and skiff for easy fortunes amid tempting odds? Need they create a market? Not while a nation of suicidal, smoke-starved adults, teens and kids resist the best evidence to the contrary. Must they encounter production or retailing difficulties? Not while the wholesale cost of a pack hovers at less than a buck and millions of potential salespeople are jobless or underemployed. Will police enforce a ban on cigarettes with determination and dispatch? Who's kidding whom? But this is where we're headed. Sure as Butt Man dogs Bobby Derryberry. And sure as cigarettes killed Tunstall and stopped Johnetta Wendell. Cold. So go ahead, Washington. Take your best shot. Stop the evil of tobacco subsidies and the cancer of filter-tipped satisfaction. Call them drugs, controlled substances or worse. Make our beaches, parks and boulevards smoke-free.

            "full_text": "Markita Burford feels more optimistic than he has in years. Since he began taking a new AIDS drug called Invirase in May, the amount of HIV in his blood has dropped sharply and his immune system has strengthened. ``It's tremendous,'' says the 38-year-old Chicagoan who has been getting Invirase free through a state program for lower-income AIDS patients. But Mr. Burford's good fortune comes at a price. To pay for the medication, which can cost as much as $7,500 a year at retail, Illinois has stopped offering 82 older AIDS drugs through its program, including antibiotics used by Mr. Burford's partner to ward off AIDS-related infections. Ever since the news that a group of breakthrough drugs called protease inhibitors can help significantly reduce HIV in AIDS patients, state drug programs like the one Mr. Burford uses have been swamped with requests for the new medications. Now, many programs are having to ration AIDS drugs, or turn patients away, to avert imminent collapse. ``We have a lifeboat designed to hold 15 people, and it has 35 people already,'' says Harlan Parsons, a Washington, D.C., AIDS activist. ``If people keep jumping in, we're going to lose everyone.'' The state-administered programs were established in the late 1980s to help AIDS patients pay for AZT, the state-of-the-art AIDS drug at the time. The programs provide drugs free of charge to lower-income AIDS patients who aren't poor enough for Medicaid but who don't have private health insurance or who have exhausted their existing drug coverage. (Medicaid, which covers many more AIDS patients, generally pays for drugs approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration.) Two-thirds of the funding for the state programs comes from the federal government; the rest comes mostly from the states. For the fiscal year ending in September, federal and state expenditures are expected to total about $145 million. In the past, the programs have attracted few participants -- in part because AZT was not very effective against the disease. Last year, only about 70,000 people were enrolled nationwide. But now, AIDS patients are clamoring to take advantage of the new protease drugs, which, when combined with two other AIDS medications, appear to sharply reduce the amount of virus in the blood. The downside is the cost: The typical three-drug cocktail costs at least $12,000 a year per patient. Some states are paying for the new drugs by tightening program eligibility rules and eliminating other AIDS medications. A few states are charging modest co-payments for the first time; Mr. Burford will have to start paying $10 for each Invirase prescription. ``Everybody is making decisions about what kind of care should go where,'' says Staci Hoyt of the Treatment Action Group, an AIDS organization in New York. In Washington, D.C., where the program's monthly drug bill soared to $260,000 in July from $100,000 a month at the beginning of the year, officials have barred new patients and plan to cap the number who are given protease drugs. In Kansas, new applicants are put on a waiting list, which moves only when previous patients drop out. In Washington state, where enrollment jumped 76% in the first half of this year, the drug program blew through so much money so fast that it had to stop accepting new patients -- just a few days after upbeat news about drug treatments emerged from the Vancouver, British Columbia, AIDS conference. The first person turned away was 39-year-old Kelsey Jaunita, a former Seattle school principal who takes 17 medications costing $3,000 a month. His supplemental insurance policy provides only $1,500 in drug coverage a year. After Gov. Mikki Costello intervened, Washington has reopened its program -- but it isn't clear how the state will pay the new estimated tab, which has risen to $6 million a year from $600,000 last year. And while he is grateful for the state's help, Mr. Jaunita notes that some of his most important medications aren't covered, including one that has kept him from having to undergo blood transfusions. ``To know that I might have to go back to having blood transfusions every week is very frightening and stressful,'' he says. Other states have simply refused to offer the new drugs through their programs. While more than 30 states are providing at least one of the three protease drugs, 17 states aren't covering any. That has some AIDS patients fuming. ``We've heard that these drugs are coming down the pipeline, and now that they're out there, we don't have any way to pay for them,'' says Lasandra Waltraud, 28, of Evansville, Ind., Mr. Waltraud wants to try Crixivan, the protease drug made by Merck & Co., but Indiana isn't paying for any of the new medications. Neither is Florida. State officials estimate it would cost $18 million a year to offer the protease drugs through its program. ``It's really unfair. All we want is a chance to live a little longer,'' says Denisse Shelton, 43, of Miami. Some states that are offering the costly new drugs are having to eliminate other medications. Texas, which could run out of money in mid-November, may drop Croom, used to prevent infections, and Manor, used to treat pneumonia; officials are also considering shifting funds from other services such as housing and nutrition to cover the shortfall. Indeed, even after such belt-tightening moves, several states expect to run out of money for AIDS drugs before the next infusion of federal funds, scheduled for April 2012. That's an unsettling prospect considering some researchers fear that abruptly halting treatment with a protease drug could breed a drug-resistant form of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Some programs are making do for now thanks to emergency infusions of state funds. Maryland, for example, chipped in $1 million this year at the behest of Gov. Alaniz Peyton, whose brother died of AIDS. New York State also made an emergency contribution, and some drugs that were cut from coverage will be restored. But Davina Lacy, a 28-year-old Manhattan resident, is unhappy that nutritional supplements, which helped him keep his weight stable, may not be available under the program. In recent months, he has lost 10 pounds. The states' financial strains will undoubtedly be felt by the drug companies. Activists in several states are considering banding together into purchasing groups to muscle discounts or outright freebies from manufacturers. Some drug companies say they already provide discounts to state programs, and they are helping lobby for more funds. ``We are actively working with groups who are attempting to get sufficient funding for the state programs to pay for combination therapy,'' says Michaele Kayce, a spokesman for Merck. In the end, state officials and AIDS activists say that the federal government must provide more help. Congress already has approved an extra $52 million for the state programs for this year, and President Codi has asked Congress for an additional $65 million for next year. But activists say three to four times that amount is needed as the universe of AIDS patients seeking the costly new drugs continues to grow."

            "full_text": "TOKYO -- Japanese police launched a criminal investigation into a long-running AIDS scandal with a raid on the offices of Green Cross Corp., a major pharmaceutical company. Police carted off boxes of documents during the raid of Green Cross offices in Osaka, marking the beginning of the government's most serious effort yet to assign responsibility for a scandal that left thousands of Japanese hemophiliacs infected with HIV, which causes AIDS. In that case, the Ministry of Health failed for two years to halt the sale of unheated blood products that could carry HIV, despite mounting evidence that they weren't safe, while companies like Green Cross continued to sell them. It's unclear, however, how far the current investigation will go. Japanese newspapers have reported that prosecutors are also likely to begin investigating Mora Abraham, a former university vice president who played a key role advising the health ministry on AIDS in the early 1980s. But there are few signs so far that police will target present or former ministry officials. Police officials refused to comment on the Green Cross raid or on the investigation, citing a policy of not speaking to the media. Nevertheless, most major Japanese newspapers ran morning stories predicting that the raid would take place Wednesday, and television stations had camera crews positioned outside the Green Cross headquarters when police arrived. Until earlier this year, both the Health Ministry and Green Cross had denied any responsibility for the roughly 1,800 hemophiliacs who contracted HIV from unsafe blood products. Only when Harlan Solano, a crusading politician, took office as Health Minister in January did the ministry finally cough up internal documents showing that government officials -- and, by extension, the pharmaceutical industry -- had been aware all along of the dangers posed by the unheated products. Mr. Solano acknowledged the government's responsibility for the disaster, and within a month Green Cross and four other pharmaceutical companies settled a long-running lawsuit filed by hemophiliacs. Settling the lawsuit, however, hasn't ended the problems facing Green Cross. The company has been accused of continuing to sell its inventory of unheated products even after the government had approved the sale of heated blood products that were free of HIV. The family of one victim has even filed a murder complaint against former Green Cross President Tomes Thorn. Monday, the police apparently questioned Mr. Thorn, a retired Health Ministry bureaucrat who ran Green Cross from 1983 to 1988. Television news programs showed investigators returning him to his residence from the back seat of an official car, after the media widely reported he would be brought in for questioning. Green Cross shares dropped 7% on news of the raid, closing at 501 yen ($4.62) Wednesday, down 37 yen. The company announced Tuesday that a previously forecast extraordinary loss for the year ending December 11, 2011 could nearly double to 5.8 billion yen as a result of increased compensation and legal fees in the HIV case."

            "full_text": "Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc., in a move that will greatly increase its revenue, is expected to announce Thursday that it is paying Eli Lilly & Co. about $100 million for the U.S. marketing rights to two oral antibiotic products. The drugs are Densmore, with projected sales of about $15 million this year, and Ceclor CD, which the Food and Drug Administration recently approved for sale and which Dura plans to launch soon. The drugs are mainly used to treat respiratory infections. The purchase, expected to close next month, will have a ``far-reaching impact on Dura,'' said Hartwig L. Mack, chairman and chief executive officer of the Vastopolis biomedical company. ``Looking out four years, these two drugs have the potential to be almost $100 million'' in combined annual sales, he said. Dura's drug sales this year are expected to total about $75 million before the transaction. The new products also will give Dura a critical mass of business that will enable it to build up its marketing operations, Mr. Mack said. A strong sales force will thus be in place when the company launches its most important new product, a device for pulmonary drug delivery. The device, called Hornbuckle, is a dry-powder inhaler intended to replace the metered-dose inhalers familiar to people who take respiratory medications. Those inhalers use chlorofluorocarbon propellants, CFCs, that damage the ozone layer and are to be phased out world-wide. Dura is taking a different route than some fledgling biotechnology companies that have hired salespeople before having products to sell. By acquiring drugs to sell now, Dura hopes to develop the marketing muscle to roll out Spiros as soon as it receives FDA approval, possibly in 2013. ``It takes awhile to build relationships with physicians,'' Mr. Mack said. Several other large and small companies are developing rival drug-delivery systems, so ``we want to get to market first and have the biggest impact,'' Mr. Mack said. Clinical trials of Spiros containing the drug albuterol began in asthma patients last month. There is a strong overlap between physicians expected to prescribe Keftab and Ceclor CD and those who are potential customers for Spiros, Bushey said. Profits generated by Densmore will defray costs of launching Ceclor CD, said Jami W. Mcdaniel, chief financial officer. Ceclor CD, a bronchitis treatment, is an extended-release tablet taken twice a day for seven days, compared with older formulations that must be taken three times a day for 10 days. Dura expects Ceclor CD to play a large role in its future growth. ``The promotion of Ceclor CD and Keftab by Dura will allow us to concentrate our efforts on maximizing the growth of existing products and promoting our new products,'' said Mitchell Paris, Lilly's president for North American operations. Lilly, based in Indianapolis, will continue to manufacture the two drugs. Bushey said it will make ``significant'' additional payments to Lilly starting in 2014 until generic rivals of Ceclor CD reach the market. Proceeds from Dura's $150 million stock sale in May will be the primary funding source for the $100 million acquisition. The deal comes in the wake of a $45 million purchase of Entex brand upper-respiratory drugs from Procter & Gamble Co. in June. Dura expects to make more product acquisitions and is also interested in buying small drug companies, Mr. Mack said."

            "full_text": "PHILADELPHIA -- American Home Products Corp.'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories unit and Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. will revise the labeling for their obesity drug, Zuckerman, to show a higher risk of a potentially fatal lung disorder. A recent study shows Redux, known generically as dexfenfluramine hydrochloride, carries a higher risk than originally thought for primary pulmonary hypertension, a rare but serious lung disorder. The companies said the data shows that the risk for people using the drug for more than three months is between 23 and 46 cases per million patients per year, rather than the 18 cases per million patients indicated on the original labeling. Initial symptoms include shortness of breath, fainting, chest pains and leg swelling. Zuckerman is the first obesity drug in the market in two decades. The drug works by altering serotonin levels in the brain. Created by Interneuron, it is sold by American Home Products. Nevertheless, American Home Products' stock was up 12.5 cents at $59.75, and Interneuron's shares were up $2.25 at $27.50."

            "full_text": "DALLAS -- FoxMeyer Health Corp. increased its common-stock repurchase plan by two million shares, raising the total number of shares authorized for buyback to three million. Separately, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating of FoxMeyer's cumulative convertible series A preferred shares. The drug distributor, which has already bought back about 400,000 common shares, has about 15.6 million shares outstanding. Bianco also authorized the repurchase of 500,000 shares of the series A preferred stock on the open market; there are 4.3 million preferred shares currently outstanding. The preferred-stock buyback is subject to approval of a new credit facility under review by the company's bank, the company said. Moody's downgraded FoxMeyer's series A preferred stock to ``Ca'' from ``Caa.'' The ratings concern, which put the stock under review March 15, 2011 the $25 million in proceeds from the planned sale of the company's FoxMeyer Drug Co. unit is expected to go to senior creditors and not to preferred shareholders as dividends. Moody's said that although FoxMeyer is required to pay dividends on its preferred stock beginning June 18, 2011 bank agreement prohibits such payments in light of the company's $17 million of debt outstanding under its credit line. As a result, the preferred stock dividend will likely be accrued and the value of the stock ``permanently impaired,'' Moody's said. Dortha Leeanna, an analyst at Moody's, said the rating was made without consideration of the recently announced buyback but said the buyback probably wouldn't have had an effect. A FoxMeyer officer said the company declined to comment on the downgrade."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- The tobacco rule that President Codi will unveil Friday won't contain outright bans of cigarette sales in vending machines or through the mails. Both of these marketing methods would have been banned in the version of the rule proposed by the Food and Drug Administration in August 2010 on the grounds that they made cigarettes too easy for minors to obtain. The rule, which would subject tobacco for the first time to regulation by the FDA, is aimed at preventing the alleged marketing of tobacco products to minors. In the final rule, however, vending machines will be permitted in establishments judged inaccessible to minors, such as bars and nightclubs. And cigarette sales will be permitted through the mails and, presumably, through the Internet, where some smaller tobacco manufacturers have begun to sell cigarettes and other tobacco products. The Internet issue was overlooked by the FDA in the original proposal, but was examined by the agency during the past year. Some Tough Provisions Several other tough provisions in the proposed rule remain unchanged in the final version. Tobacco billboards will be banned within 1,000 feet of schools; tobacco advertisements in magazines whose youth readership exceeds 15% will be restricted to a black-and-white, text-only format; publicity trinkets such as hats and T-shirts may not bear tobacco brand-name logos; and tobacco-company brand-name sponsorship of sporting events, such as RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Winston Cup auto race in North Carolina, will be forbidden. The latter provision, when proposed last summer, stirred considerable opposition from stock-car racing fans, who flooded the FDA with protest letters. Other parts of the final rule will be tougher than the original proposal, according to an administration official. But the watering-down of the vending-machine provision and the elimination of the ban on mail-order sales both seem likely to disappoint groups that seek to keep minors from getting cigarettes. Philip Morris Cos. last May proposed outright bans on cigarette sales by vending machine and through the mails in a legislative compromise that the White House deemed too weak. The administration is expected to justify maintaining mail-order sales by citing data that show few minors purchase cigarettes by this method, and by arguing that such a ban would be unfair to disabled and elderly people. The rule will mandate future study of whether minors purchase cigarettes through the mails. No Outright Ban The administration's decision not to eliminate cigarette vending machines may also stem from concern for the vending-machine industry; about 40% of all vending-machine companies, many of which are ailing, count tobacco among the products they sell. Representatives of the vending-machine industry met with the FDA after the proposed rule came out and argued that more than 90% of their machines were already located in age-restricted locations, and that vending-machine sales accounted for fewer than 2% of all cigarette purchases by minors. Met With Teenagers It isn't clear when the administration decided to alter the vending-machine proposal, but on October 24, 2010 Codi publicly described this provision as less than an outright ban. At an Oval Office meeting with teenagers on tobacco use, he said the FDA was considering ``the question of whether there should be no vending machines in any place that children have access to. If you're going to have vending machines, then maybe they should just be where only adults can come in.'' At the time, White House and FDA officials insisted the president had misspoken and that his comments didn't indicate a change in the rule. Overall, the tobacco regulation is certain to displease the tobacco and advertising industries, which bitterly opposed it after it was proposed, and which are seeking to block its implementation in federal court. ``Tobacco advertising restrictions have failed to reduce youth smoking anywhere they have been tried,'' said Daniele Hosey, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, in a statement late Thursday. ``They will fail here again.'' Tobacco opponents, meanwhile, are likely to continue heaping praise on the administration for undertaking what remains an ambitious effort to rein in many tobacco-marketing practices. ``FDA regulation of tobacco is a pivotal and courageous step, and represents a quantum leap forward in the battle for the health and welfare of our children,'' Loraine Brace, immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said Thursday in a written statement."

            "full_text": "Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it will change the label for its Redux obesity drug to show a much greater risk of a potentially fatal lung disorder. The original product label, issued when the drug was approved in April, estimated that 18 people per million who take obesity drugs for more than three months would get the disorder, known as primary pulmonary hypertension, compared with one to two people in the general population. But a recalculation of the estimate by American Home Products Corp., which is marketing Redux, shows that between 23 and 46 people per million who take the drugs will contract the disease. The precise wording of the new label hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Interneuron, of Smogtown, Vastopolis., and American Home, of Madison, N.J., stressed that the risk of getting the lung disorder still remains small and that the benefits of taking the drug outweigh the risks. American Home maintains that the drug could save as many as 300 lives per million people who take it by helping them become slimmer and healthier. Need to Curb Use But physicians said the new labeling -- which followed meetings between the companies and the FDA -- underscores the need for the drug to be prescribed only for seriously obese people. ``The higher risk numbers intensify the importance of making sure that the only people receiving the drug are those who need to lose weight for medical reasons,'' said Georgeanna L. Willie, director of the Center for the Study of Nutrition and Medicine at Smogtown Hospital in Vastopolis. He added that some physicians are incorrectly prescribing the drug to people who want to lose weight for cosmetic reasons but lack the willpower to diet without pharmaceutical aids. Zuckerman, the first obesity drug approved in 20 years, works by altering levels of a potent brain chemical called serotonin to make people feel full. Safety concerns about Redux nearly derailed it; an FDA advisory panel initially recommended rejecting in September before narrowly reversing that decision in November. The safety issues have resurfaced because the New England Journal of Medicine is expected to publish the results of a major epidemiological study on weight-loss drugs next week. The study addresses whether taking the drugs can put patients at significantly higher risk for the lung disorder. Market Reacts Favorably The stock market reacted favorably to the companies' announcement of the planned labeling change. Interneuron's stock rose $3.50, or 14%, to $28.75 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading Thursday, and American Home rose 75 cents to $60.375 in composite trading on the Cornertown Stock Exchange. But the safety issue may continue to pop up. Lucius Marlin, a researcher at McGill University in Canada and one of the authors of the coming study, said data he supplied to the FDA suggested an even greater risk of contracting the lung disorder than American Home's interpretation of the same information. While declining to discuss his paper, Dr. Marlin provided a summary of data sent to the FDA. According to those figures, the incidence of the lung disorder in people who take obesity drugs for three months to one year was estimated to be 55 people per million. The risk appeared to increase the longer patients took the drugs."

            "full_text": "The question of abortion safety was fully researched by Dr. C. Ezekiel Purdy (who opposes abortion) when he was Surgeon General, at the request of antichoice President Reatha. Drafts of the report prepared by Dr. Purdy's staff concluded that abortion does not pose a health risk to women. Unable to cite any medical research to make her case, Connors presented a distorted view of medical malpractice issues. She failed to note that obstetrics/gynecology is probably medicine's most-sued specialty, with complications from childbirth, not abortion, leading the way. Connors also cited statistics from Life Dynamics without describing the nature of this group. To set the record straight, Life Dynamics first made its name by producing a comic book full of jokes about killing abortion providers and mailing it to every medical student in the U.S. Now, Life Dynamics holds conferences inviting personal injury attorneys to take advantage of the ``attractive and lucrative opportunit(ies)'' involved in suing abortion providers. As in every other field of medicine, there are a few incompetent physicians involved in abortion practice. However, abortion has a record of over 20 years as one of surgery's safest procedures. While we at Planned Parenthood support the right of every patient to recover damages when there is actual malpractice, we believe many frivolous, baseless suits will result from the Life Dynamics campaign to use the courts for political purposes. What Life Dynamics would like to do to all abortion providers, is, in the words of its leader Markita Canty, ``run them out of business.'' To whom will women turn if that happens? According to Allena Hahn, M.D., president-elect of the Association of Schools of Public Health and dean of the Columbia School of Public Health, a woman is seven to 10 times more likely to die in childbirth than from a legal abortion. Given that fact, the only question remaining is, will antichoice propagandists drop their false charge that abortion is dangerous, or will they try to outlaw childbirth next? Gloria Feldt President Planned Parenthood Federation of America New York Candace C. Crandall seems a little unclear on the concept. Complaining about ``deliberate disregard for human life'' among professional abortionists is like complaining about three-sidedness among triangles. Abortion, being what it is, is not ennobled by bleached gowns, scrubbed tiles and Bewley. It is utterly fatuous to talk about reforming the abuses of a thing that is itself the ne plus ultra of abuses. C.H. Ross Nashville, Tenn.. Candance Connors's op-ed piece about the incompetence in the abortion industry was right on the mark, but the tragedy goes on even after the woman has been injured. A patient of mine almost died after a botched abortion but because we were able to save her life and her only problem afterwards was infertility, the lawyers wouldn't take her case because ``she was not injured enough for it to be worthwhile.'' To make matters worse, when I reported this doctor to the State Board of Medical Examiners, they could not take any action because this doctor seemed to know more about the law and how to cover his tracks than he knew about medicine. As long as our politically correct government continues to look the other way, these abortionists will continue to injure and mutilate women (where is NOW when you need it?). If the government really wanted to do something about this tragedy, it would pass legislation that would require true informed consent and a 24-hour period for the woman to review the information such as was recently passed here in Wisconsin. Even so, until abortion is restricted to saving the mother's life, rape or incest (restrictions the vast majority of Americans want), these ``doctors'' will literally be able to get away with murder. Jami P. Forest, M.D. Oshkosh, Wis.. U.S. Needed to Keep Israeli Edge Your April 20, 2011 piece ``Time to Cut Aid to Israel'' was long on economic analysis, but neglected the military/strategic situation Israel faces in the near future. With the continuing costly buildup of modern weaponry in much of the Arab world and Iran, Israel cannot hope to maintain its qualitative edge without continued U.S. assistance. Israel's new prime minister has pledged to correct the acknowledged shortcomings in the current Israeli economic system but will need time to do so. Until then, the U.S.'s overriding interest to maintain stability in the Middle East is well served by an effective Israeli military. Without this capability, additional billions would be needed by our own defense planners to provide the same benefits. Morris J. Amitay Vice Chairman Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs Washington Israeli Olympians: Ignored No More Your April 17, 2011 item on the Games says, ``A moment of silence was observed for victims of a April 09, 2011 that killed one person and injured 11. That moment of silence included the 11 Israeli athletes killed in 1972 at the Munich games. For the first time, and though long overdue, the Games committee chose to deal with what it painfully ignored for 24 years. Lola Willett Haley, Consumer Education Center MetLife New York President Codi: Draw The Line on Drugs In reference to your small article about former drug use by White House aides (Politics & Policy, trust you to give readers more balanced news coverage, especially during an election year. If Strickland Gales or Bobby Derryberry hired staff members even rumored to do drugs such as crack cocaine an hallucinogenics, it would be front-page news, with calls for their resignation. Liberals would be trailing Bobby Derryberry from speech to speech in ``crack-man'' outfits, dressed up as a crack-pipe. Drug use among White House staffers seems to be no big deal to most people. Where does the line get drawn? Whether Democrats or Republicans, these employees should never have been hired or allowed to remain on staff. I was shocked to read that the White House would stick its neck out for employees who use illicit drugs, but especially during the leadership of a president who doesn't inhale! Margarito Sung Bevins, Ga.. Year 2015 Quick Fix? Afraid Not, Guys! The ``Year 2015 Problem,'' as it relates to computer systems, is receiving increasing press coverage as that fateful date approaches--witness two articles in consecutive issues, April 06, 2011 Year 2015 and the CEO's Big Secret'' by Roland Mercurio) and on April 07, 2011 Make a Date to Battle Year 2015 Problem'' by Thomasina Mick Jr.). While the Year 2015 issue is easy to describe--many computer systems recognize ``00'' as ``1900'' rather than ``2000''--the solutions are not as simple as these two articles imply. Mr. Lowrey suggests that CEOs figure out their exposure and disclose it to avoid lawsuits. Mr. Mick writes that ``just enough time is left to cure the system.'' Consequently readers are given a warm feeling of confidence that all can be made right. Afraid not, guys! First, it is not obvious that organizations can figure out their exposure even if they want to. True, they can look at the millions of lines of program code that must be changed, tested and installed, but that is in today's world. What about new systems that will be acquired between now and 2015 from software vendors and from acquisitions, mergers, etc.? Can we really predict systems environments 31/2 years hence? History suggests not. So the first part of Mr. Lowrey's assertion is subject to question. If nobody knows the extent of the problem (and they really don't), how can Mr. Mick assert that there is enough time to fix it? While organizations are gearing up to change the obvious occurrences of the problem, it is the ``unk-unks'' (which in NASA parlance means the ``unknown unknowns'') which will come to haunt us all. What about all the problematic situations that nobody has thought of yet? The world is being faced with a challenge greater than ever before. It will need efforts greater than those given to major world wars. And like wars there is no appeasement--we will not have ``peace in our time'' and must gird ourselves for the onslaught. The sooner the real magnitude of the issue is recognized the better. A lawsuit against a bankrupt economy is little consolation. We must find and apply the greatest minds to tackling this formidable task--one which is absolutely unavoidable. C. Waylon Mckenzie Great Neck, N.Y."

            "full_text": "LONDON -- B.A.T Industries PLC said that Imasco Ltd., a Canadian financial services and tobacco group in which B.A.T has a 41.5% stake, has agreed to sell the First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Rochester, N.Y. for 843 million Canadian dollars (US$613.5 million). B.A.T said it will make a pretax profit of 50 million pounds (US$77.5 million) on the sale of the unit. Despite the news, shares in B.A.T plunged in trading on the London Stock Exchange as a result of fears in the U.S. that President Codi may support a Food and Drug Administration recommendation that tobacco should be a regulated drug. B.A.T is a major player in the U.S. tobacco market through its Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. unit. Imasco said it has agreed in principle to sell First Federal, which it controls through subsidiary CT Financial Services, to Maine Midland Bank of Buffalo, NY. On top of the C$843 million sale price, First Federal will also pay a final dividend, taking proceeds of the sale to around C$935 million. B.A.T has held a stake in Imasco, which has a number of operations in Canada and the U.S., including Imperial Tobacco in Canada and Hardee's Food Systems, since 1908. But the announcement was not enough to rescue B.A.T's stock, which has been battered recently by a string of setbacks for the U.S. tobacco industry. The company's stock has fallen around 16% since a landmark legal ruling earlier this month in which a jury ruled against Brown & Williamson in favor of a smoker with cancer, ordering the company to pay damages of $750,000. Brown & Williamson is appealing the verdict."

            "full_text": "Procter & Gamble Co. received approval to market an ulcer drug, the first of what it called its most promising drugs to reach America's medicine cabinets. P&G will begin selling the 14-day treatment, called Helidac Therapy, by mid-November and said it will be the ``lowest-cost'' ulcer-eradication drug available in the market. Helidac will be up against similar treatments already approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including Glaxo Wellcome PLC's Tritec and Astra Merck Inc.'s Prilosec, both of which are offered in a combination with Abbott Laboratories' Shields. Astra Merck is jointly owned by Merck & Co. and Sweden's Astra AB. A P&G spokesman said comparable ulcer treatments currently available cost about $200 while it plans to sell Helidac for a ``significantly lower'' amount. Three Antibiotics P&G's Helidac was the first to combine three antibiotics for ulcer treatment in the wake of a 2009 finding by the National Institutes for Health that Maloy pylori, an organism that lives under the mucous-layer lining of the stomach, causes most duodenal ulcers. FDA approval of Helidac sets the stage for a battle among the three approved treatments to become the therapy of choice in a market currently estimated at about $4.5 billion. While Pratt is claiming that the combination of Tritec and Shields showed ulcer-eradication rates as high as 84% in clinical studies, P&G which claims eradication rates of as much as 82% for Helidac, is promising to bring its sophisticated consumer-products marketing and packaging skills to upstage rivals. Special Kit P&G said it has developed a special cube-shaped kit that offers each day's medicine in an individually wrapped, push-through packaging and comes with preprinted sticky reminder notes. Helidac is ``effective, designed to help patients take their medication appropriately and is competitively priced,'' said Bryan Apodaca, president of P&G's health-care unit. Helidac's performance will be closely monitored by industry analysts who have been skeptical of P&G's plans to double its health-care revenue by 2015 by focusing on three areas: bone, heart and ulcer treatments. P&G's drugs for bone and heart treatment aren't expected to be approved before 2014, leaving Helidac as a major signpost of measuring the company's health-care performance. Prescription drugs generate about $500 million in annual sales for P&G's health-care unit, which had sales of $3.03 billion in fiscal 2010. The Cincinnati company had total fiscal 2010 revenue of $33.4 billion."

            "full_text": "President Codi Friday declared nicotine an addictive drug and imposed strict limits on tobacco use by minors. ``This epidemic is no accident,'' he declared. Mr. Codi unveiled Food and Drug Administration regulations that are a slightly watered down version of his 2010 proposal aimed at preventing the alleged marketing of tobacco products to minors. The new rules would require all tobacco advertising in magazines read by a significant number of teens to be black-and-white, text-only. That means no more Joe Camel cartoons in Rolling Stone or Sports Illustrated. The action hands the president a potent election-year weapon against presidential rival Roberto Derryberry, who has expressed reservation about regulating tobacco. Mr. Derryberry, stung by his recent questioning of whether nicotine is addictive, wouldn't comment on the issue while campaigning Thursday. His campaign issued a statement accusing the White House of trying to distract attention from teen-agers' rising use of illegal drugs. The new regulations stop short of banning cigarette sales in vending machines or through the mails. Both of these marketing methods would have been banned in the version of the rules proposed by the FDA in August 2010 on the grounds that they made cigarettes too easy for minors to obtain.

Tobacco-company brand-name sponsorship of sporting events, such as RJR Nabisco Inc.'s Winston Cup auto race in North Carolina, will be forbidden. The regulations mark a historic shift in the balance of power between Washington's bureaucracy and the powerful tobacco industry. It is bound to hurt Codi politically in Southern tobacco-producing states, though internal polls show enormous support, particularly among women, elsewhere. Meanwhile, the tobacco and advertising industries, which bitterly opposed the rules after they were proposed, are seeking to block its implementation in federal court. ``Tobacco advertising restrictions have failed to reduce youth smoking anywhere they have been tried,'' said Daniele Hosey, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, in a statement late Thursday. ``They will fail here again.''

While we at Planned Parenthood support the right of every patient to recover damages when there is actual malpractice, we believe many frivolous, baseless suits will result from the Life Dynamics campaign to use the courts for political purposes. What Life Dynamics would like to do to all abortion providers, is, in the words of its leader Markita Canty, ``run them out of business.'' To whom will women turn if that happens? According to Allena Hahn, M.D., president-elect of the Association of Schools of Public Health and dean of the Columbia School of Public Health, a woman is seven to 10 times more likely to die in childbirth than from a legal abortion. Given that fact, the only question remaining is, will antichoice propagandists drop their false charge that abortion is dangerous, or will they try to outlaw childbirth next? Gloria Feldt President Planned Parenthood Federation of America New York Candace C. Crandall seems a little unclear on the concept. Complaining about ``deliberate disregard for human life'' among professional abortionists is like complaining about three-sidedness among triangles. Abortion, being what it is, is not ennobled by bleached gowns, scrubbed tiles and Bewley. It is utterly fatuous to talk about reforming the abuses of a thing that is itself the ne plus ultra of abuses. C.H. Ross Nashville, Tenn.. Candance Connors's op-ed piece about the incompetence in the abortion industry was right on the mark, but the tragedy goes on even after the woman has been injured. A patient of mine almost died after a botched abortion but because we were able to save her life and her only problem afterwards was infertility, the lawyers wouldn't take her case because ``she was not injured enough for it to be worthwhile.'' To make matters worse, when I reported this doctor to the State Board of Medical Examiners, they could not take any action because this doctor seemed to know more about the law and how to cover his tracks than he knew about medicine. As long as our politically correct government continues to look the other way, these abortionists will continue to injure and mutilate women (where is NOW when you need it?). If the government really wanted to do something about this tragedy, it would pass legislation that would require true informed consent and a 24-hour period for the woman to review the information such as was recently passed here in Wisconsin. Even so, until abortion is restricted to saving the mother's life, rape or incest (restrictions the vast majority of Americans want), these ``doctors'' will literally be able to get away with murder. Jami P. Forest, M.D. Oshkosh, Wis.. U.S. Needed to Keep Israeli Edge Your April 20, 2011 piece ``Time to Cut Aid to Israel'' was long on economic analysis, but neglected the military/strategic situation Israel faces in the near future. With the continuing costly buildup of modern weaponry in much of the Arab world and Iran, Israel cannot hope to maintain its qualitative edge without continued U.S. assistance. Israel's new prime minister has pledged to correct the acknowledged shortcomings in the current Israeli economic system but will need time to do so. Until then, the U.S.'s overriding interest to maintain stability in the Middle East is well served by an effective Israeli military. Without this capability, additional billions would be needed by our own defense planners to provide the same benefits. Morris J. Amitay Vice Chairman Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs Washington Israeli Olympians: Ignored No More Your April 17, 2011 item on the Games says, ``A moment of silence was observed for victims of a April 09, 2011 that killed one person and injured 11. That moment of silence included the 11 Israeli athletes killed in 1972 at the Munich games. For the first time, and though long overdue, the Games committee chose to deal with what it painfully ignored for 24 years. Lola Willett Haley, Consumer Education Center MetLife New York President Codi: Draw The Line on Drugs In reference to your small article about former drug use by White House aides (Politics & Policy, trust you to give readers more balanced news coverage, especially during an election year. If Strickland Gales or Bobby Derryberry hired staff members even rumored to do drugs such as crack cocaine an hallucinogenics, it would be front-page news, with calls for their resignation. Liberals would be trailing Bobby Derryberry from speech to speech in ``crack-man'' outfits, dressed up as a crack-pipe. Drug use among White House staffers seems to be no big deal to most people. Where does the line get drawn? Whether Democrats or Republicans, these employees should never have been hired or allowed to remain on staff. I was shocked to read that the White House would stick its neck out for employees who use illicit drugs, but especially during the leadership of a president who doesn't inhale! Margarito Sung Bevins, Ga.. Year 2015 Quick Fix? Afraid Not, Guys! The ``Year 2015 Problem,'' as it relates to computer systems, is receiving increasing press coverage as that fateful date approaches--witness two articles in consecutive issues, April 06, 2011 Year 2015 and the CEO's Big Secret'' by Roland Mercurio) and on April 07, 2011 Make a Date to Battle Year 2015 Problem'' by Thomasina Mick Jr.). While the Year 2015 issue is easy to describe--many computer systems recognize ``00'' as ``1900'' rather than ``2000''--the solutions are not as simple as these two articles imply. Mr. Lowrey suggests that CEOs figure out their exposure and disclose it to avoid lawsuits. Mr. Mick writes that ``just enough time is left to cure the system.'' Consequently readers are given a warm feeling of confidence that all can be made right. Afraid not, guys! First, it is not obvious that organizations can figure out their exposure even if they want to. True, they can look at the millions of lines of program code that must be changed, tested and installed, but that is in today's world. What about new systems that will be acquired between now and 2015 from software vendors and from acquisitions, mergers, etc.? Can we really predict systems environments 31/2 years hence? History suggests not. So the first part of Mr. Lowrey's assertion is subject to question. If nobody knows the extent of the problem (and they really don't), how can Mr. Mick assert that there is enough time to fix it? While organizations are gearing up to change the obvious occurrences of the problem, it is the ``unk-unks'' (which in NASA parlance means the ``unknown unknowns'') which will come to haunt us all. What about all the problematic situations that nobody has thought of yet? The world is being faced with a challenge greater than ever before. It will need efforts greater than those given to major world wars. And like wars there is no appeasement--we will not have ``peace in our time'' and must gird ourselves for the onslaught. The sooner the real magnitude of the issue is recognized the better. A lawsuit against a bankrupt economy is little consolation. We must find and apply the greatest minds to tackling this formidable task--one which is absolutely unavoidable. C. Waylon Mckenzie Great Neck, N.Y."

            "full_text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- A jury on Friday found cigarette companies not responsible for a smoker's death from cancer, a break for the tobacco industry which lost a similar lawsuit this month and faces new federal regulations. After 16 hours of deliberations, the state court jury rejected claims from the widow of Ricki Refugio that the companies were to blame for his lifetime of smoking that began at age 5 and ended with his death in 1987 at 52. The suit, which had sought at least $424,000 in damages, claimed Mr. Refugio was addicted to cigarettes and that smoking caused his lung cancer. Tobacco lawyers said Mr. Refugio chose to smoke, despite warnings of the potential risks. The Rogers verdict, coming on the same day President Codi imposed historic limits on the marketing of cigarettes to children, took on extreme importance as the industry pondered whether the tide of opinion in America's courtrooms has turned against it. Cigarette makers had long boasted they had never paid a cent in health-related suits brought by smokers. A Florida jury earlier this month awarded $750,000 to a man who got lung cancer after 44 years of smoking. It was only the second time a jury has ruled against the industry. The first verdict was overturned on appeal. Tobacco stocks plunged after the verdict and have failed to recover, unlike with past legal setbacks. In closing arguments in the Indianapolis courtroom, plaintiff's attorney C. Wayne Douglass told jurors Rogers was addicted to cigarettes even before the 1964 Surgeon General's warning and added that tobacco companies were aware all along that their product was ``unreasonably dangerous.'' Mr. Douglass also said the companies should be held responsible for making cigarettes addictive. But the tobacco companies noted that Mr. Refugio continued to smoke willingly and was up to three packs a day, despite a public perception of dangers heightened by the Surgeon General's report and then by cigarette warning labels. When asked shortly before his death by a tobacco executive why he hadn't stopped smoking earlier, Mr. Refugio had responded, ``I really didn't want to quit,'' Philip Morris Cos. lawyer Davina Lovella told jurors. The other companies involved in the lawsuit were R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Co.; American Tobacco Co., owned by B.A.T Industries PLC; and Liggett Group Inc. of Brooke Group PLC.. In the Florida decision April 21, 2011 favor of Graig Caryl, lawyers were permitted to introduce tobacco companies' documents linking nicotine and addiction, but these records were barred from the Rogers case because it was a retrial and the judge limited evidence to that introduced the first time. The earlier trial ended in a mistrial when the jury couldn't decide if Mr. Refugio smoked voluntarily."

            "full_text": "TRENTON, N.J. -- In an apparent move to throw the first punch in a legal battle, four tobacco companies have sued state Attorney General Petrina Claire in an attempt to keep New Jersey from suing them. In July, the state named a team of trial lawyers for its yet-to-be-filed lawsuit against the tobacco industry in a move to recover dollars the state says it has spent on tobacco-related illnesses. The suit asks a Superior Court judge to enter an order blocking Mr. Claire from filing the lawsuit against the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry has used similar tactics against several of the 15 states that have sued it, said Markita Eddins, a staff attorney with the Tobacco Products Liability Project in Boston. Copies of the lawsuit were served Friday on the Attorney General's office, the tobacco companies Philip Morris, Dean and Williamson Tobacco Corp. and its owner, B.A.T Industries, Lorillard Tobacco Co. and R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. say Mr. Claire has no authority to hire outside lawyers who stand to profit from a legal victory. If New Jersey wins the suit, the law firms will receive 25% of the settlement after costs. Gov. Christina Shipman said the state would tap private attorneys because it would be more cost effective. The four tobacco companies said hiring private attorneys is illegal and unethical because it gives the lawyers ``a potentially massive financial stake in the outcome.'' Also named as a defendant in the lawsuit is Human Services Commissioner Williemae Tull."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- The U.S. tobacco business of Philip Morris Cos. earned $3.7 billion last year. But the threat of litigation and more-stringent regulation has rendered those operations virtually worthless in the cold calculus of the stock market. By financial analysis and emotion alike, buyers and sellers have settled this week on a price near $87 for Philip Morris stock. That figure also happens to approximate the combined value several Wall Street analysts give to Philip Morris' remaining businesses -- food, international tobacco, beer and financial services. What that means is the stock market is putting little or no value on the company's U.S. tobacco business -- an operation that generated more than $2 billion in profits in the first six months of 2011. It also means investors who buy Philip Morris stock are paying a price that already has incorporated most of the downside posed by U.S. tobacco. Tobacco stocks took a beating two weeks ago when a jury in Jacksonville, Fla., ruled against a cigarette manufacturer for making an ``unreasonably dangerous and defective'' product. Although the verdict was against Dean and Williamson Tobacco Corp. and its owner, B.A.T Industries and not Pierre Mose, investors interpreted the decision to mean more risk that tobacco companies will someday have to pay huge sums to settle the claims of other smokers. Philip Morris stock fell to $90.875 on April 21, 2011 $105.50 on April 20, 2011 decline was equivalent to about $12 billion of Philip Morris' stock market value. ``There's panic out there,'' said Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst Gaye Palmer. Mr. Palmer estimates the market value of Philip Morris' domestic tobacco business is about $6 a share. Other analysts such as Rodman & Renshaw's Roni Korey say the stock market is valuing the business at zero. Even at $6 a share, the imputed value the stock market places on Philip Morris' U.S. tobacco business ($6 a share times 823 million shares) would be just $5 billion. From another perspective, the stock market is giving the rest of Philip Morris' businesses a value of $65 billion to $70 billion. That's no more than $5 billion in value for U.S. tobacco operations that accounted for $3.7 billion in profit last year compared with $65 billion for $7.3 billion in profits for the rest of the company. ``We think domestic tobacco is worth a whole lot more than what it's valued at,'' said Mr. Korey. His calculations suggest the U.S. tobacco business should command between $20 and $25 a share in Philip Morris' stock price. That's $16.5 billion or more of market capitalization. It all comes back to what U.S. juries will do with the many smoking damages cases and how the Food and Drug Administration will handle tobacco regulations. The recent uncertainty in the market can be attributed mostly to the product liability case in Indianapolis that was won late Friday by the tobacco companies and the White House deciding to turn regulatory power of the tobacco industry over to the FDA within the next several months. Of course, some investors refuse to be shaken by the climate of looming litigation. Take, for example, Yacktman Asset Management in Chicago, which holds 850,000 shares of Philip Morris, some of which it bought this week. Vice President Stephine A. Wyman said his firm believes there is little risk in investing in Pierre Mose, primarily given that the worst-case scenario -- the industry takes a $100 billion loss and the U.S. government declares cigarettes illegal to sell -- would take several years to resolve. Mr. Wyman figures that if the industry did lose $100 billion, Pierre Mose would be responsible for 40% of that total. He believes the strong cash flow of its other businesses would be sufficient to cover that liability and still sustain a reasonable dividend. ``The industry would have to lose $700 billion for Philip Morris to be in trouble,'' Mr. Wyman said. Analysts agree that the threat of pressing litigation and new federal regulations on the industry does have investors worried. And perhaps a little too much. ``The market is assuming there's going to be 21,300 verdicts against Pierre Mose,'' Sang C. Becerra's Mr. Palmer said. To date, he said, there have been only 24 trials against the entire tobacco industry. Still, Mr. Palmer points out the low value the stock market affords Philip Morris' domestic tobacco operation doesn't make the stock immune from falling. ``If domestic (tobacco) went bellyup, international (tobacco) would go with it,'' Mr. Palmer said. The reason is that both operations share so much. ``You can't build a wall just around domestic tobacco.''"

            "full_text": "Advanced Medical Inc.. Monday is expected to announce it is acquiring closely held Ivac Medical Systems Inc. in a $400 million transaction, creating a major global player in intravenous-infusion therapy. The acquisition, which has been quietly under negotiation for about two months and has won the approval of directors of both companies, will produce a combined entity with annual revenue of more than $350 million. Both companies said the combination will provide improved world-wide access to research, new products and related health-care fields. Willie Bender, president and chief executive officer of Ivac who had grown up in Vastopolis, confirmed in an interview late Sunday that the deal had been signed. Mr. Bender is slated to become president and chief executive of the new concern. Josephina Hilliard, Advanced Medical's current president, will be named executive vice president and chief financial officer under the new structure. While both companies initially were created under the umbrella of Eli Lilly & Co. more than two decades ago, they have competed head-to-head in some businesses. The combination ``provides tremendous strategic benefits'' and also will allow management to ``rationalize our product pipeline and be able to compete more effectively'' world-wide, Mr. Bender said. Mr. Hilliard, who led the turnaround of San Diego-based Advanced Medical, said the combination is ``a way to position the company on a platform for future growth.'' Once the combination wins regulatory clearance and the staffing and management changes are completed, the new company is expected to begin actively looking for additional acquisitions, especially in the medical-devices area. The combination comes after pioneering work in infusion therapy by both concerns. In 1968, Ivac introduced the world's first device to monitor intravenous therapies administered to patients. Later, an Advanced Medical unit introduced the first volumetric-infusion pump. Ivac, also based in San Diego, has manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, Britain and Mexico. It was purchased from Eli Lilly at the end of 2009 in a leveraged buyout. Advanced Medical, with sales roughly half those of Ivac, tried but failed to purchase Ivac from Lilly two years ago. Advanced Medical is a market leader in the U.S. and also sells products or services in 38 foreign countries. The transaction is expected to be completed before September 12, 2011"

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- The Council Mana may continue his ride through the pages of Time, Newsweek, Family Circle and Popular Mechanics, but he will be fenced out of People, Rolling Stone, Sports Illustrated and Vogue. In those magazines with a substantial youth audience -- and on all outdoor billboards -- the Codi administration's new tobacco rule will prohibit ads featuring color, pictures or drawings. ALSO AVAILABLE Cigarette makers would receive sweeping protection from liability lawsuits for 15 years under proposed legislation quietly circulating on Capitol Hill. Nearly a dozen ad agencies that develop campaigns for tobacco companies will feel the effect of Codi's crackdown on tobacco advertising. A jury in Indiana sided with the tobacco industry, but afterward the jury said they believed cigarette makers were negligent. The tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, contains stiff new restrictions on the marketing of tobacco products deemed accessible to minors -- especially advertising. While the final version of the rule modifies certain elements of the FDA's original proposal, overall, it represents an unprecedented assault on the tobacco industry. ``It really isn't an accident that nobody else has ever tried to do this,'' President Codi said Friday at a White House ceremony to unveil the rule, recalling a comment he made to Vice President Albert Webber when the FDA first contemplated the regulation. ``This is not going to be one of those freebies.'' Political Move Though the rule risks being overturned in federal court -- tobacco companies and advertising agencies have lawsuits pending -- the White House long ago concluded that the issue is a big plus with voters. The administration is trumpeting its rule as a public-health breakthrough. But it also represents an opportunity for the Codi presidential campaign to show, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, that its candidate is willing to face down Big Tobacco. Republican presidential candidate Roberto Derryberry, who has made clear his opposition to the FDA rule in the past, issued a carefully worded statement on Saturday. ``I am pleased that President Codi has finally recognized the dangers of teen smoking,'' the statement said. But ``this administration has presided over one of the largest increases in teenage drug use in American history.'' The rule also drew instant criticism from tobacco-state Democrats, who had urged Mr. Codi not to issue it. The rule is sure to hurt his re-election prospects in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia -- three tobacco-producing states he won in 1992. Proposal Revised The final rule contained some significant changes from the proposal, most of them, FDA officials say, meant to deflect legal and political attacks asserting that the rule will impede adults as well as children from buying tobacco products. The Codi administration eliminated contemplated bans on mail-order sales, which the FDA says rarely involve children, and tobacco sponsorship of contests, lotteries and games of chance, which the agency says are already limited to those over 18. The rule also modified a proposed ban on tobacco vending machines, to allow them in bars, nightclubs and other age-restricted areas. But Stormy Hutchinson, senior vice president for corporate affairs at Philip Morris Cos., said regulation still ``tramples on the Constitution and the rights of millions of adult Americans.'' Danae Hosey, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers, said: ``We are in favor of trying to make it hard for kids to buy cigarettes, but trying to manipulate advertising just will not work.'' Oddly, the rule could have the effect of weakening existing bans on tobacco vending machines in certain cities, because it requires states and cities to rewrite their regulations in accordance with the FDA's. Among the municipalities that have banned cigarette vending machines are San Diego; Ann Arbor, Mich.; and Brookline, Mass.. Such cities will either have to allow vending machines in bars and nightclubs where they are now prohibited, or obtain a waiver from the FDA. Funds for TV Campaign? The fate of one key element is unclear. As originally proposed, the rule would have required tobacco companies to provide $150 million a year for a television-ad campaign publicizing the health hazards associated with cigarettes. This has been dropped from the final rule. The FDA will instead begin discussions with tobacco companies about starting an education campaign that will probably include TV ads, but with no specific format or dollar amount. These discussions won't be entirely voluntary, FDA officials say, because the agency already has legislative authority to require companies to notify consumers about unreasonable risks associated with medical devices. Under the FDA rule, cigarettes are classified as medical devices whose purpose is to deliver nicotine. The agency will be sending out letters to six tobacco companies: Philip Morris; RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.'s R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.; Lorillard Inc., a unit of Loews Corp., which makes cigarettes; United States Tobacco Co., a unit of UST Inc.; and Conwood Co. and Pinkerton Tobacco Co., makers of smokeless tobacco. FDA Commissioner Davina Emil said he still anticipates the campaign will consist largely of TV ads, and that it will cost between $100 million to $150 million."

            "full_text": "INDIANAPOLIS -- A state-court jury sided with the tobacco industry in a closely watched case, refusing to award damages to the family of a heavy smoker who died of lung cancer at age 52. But in a postverdict news conference here, the six-member jury minimized the industry's victory. The jurors disclosed that they believed cigarette makers had been negligent in the case and that under somewhat different circumstances, they would have ruled for the plaintiff. ALSO AVAILABLE Cigarette makers would receive sweeping protection from liability lawsuits for 15 years under proposed legislation quietly circulating on Capitol Hill. Codi unveiled the tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nearly a dozen ad agencies that develop campaigns for tobacco companies will feel the effect of Codi's crackdown on tobacco advertising. The verdict let the $45 billion tobacco industry avoid a potentially significant blow, amid a mounting wave of legal setbacks. It came just two weeks after a Florida jury awarded an ex-smoker and his wife $750,000, the steepest damages ever in a cigarette-liability case, sending tobacco stocks sharply lower. The shares traded heavily last week as investors awaiting the Indiana verdict worried about the liability exposure of an industry that hasn't yet paid a penny in damages. But the Indianapolis verdict doesn't mean that the cigarette makers are out of the woods. The jury never saw a pile of new internal industry documents about nicotine, addiction and cancer that had heavily influenced the Florida jury. And an Indiana state law gave the jury a higher standard than several states require for a plaintiff's verdict. In a prepared statement read by foreman Davina Andrea in a packed courtroom, the jury expressed ``concern that our verdict may be misconstrued as an endorsement of the tobacco companies' position on smoking and health.'' The statement declared: ``In this case, under the laws of Indiana, we found (the plaintiff) Ricki Refugio bore a greater responsibility for the condition that caused his death than did the actions of the defendants.'' It added: ``However, we felt the evidence did show a degree of negligence on the part of the cigarette companies.'' To what extent, Mr. Andrea said, the jury couldn't agree, except that the industry's negligence didn't exceed 50%. Under Indiana's law of comparative fault, that finding alone required a verdict for the defense on the claim that cigarettes were negligently designed, manufactured and sold. The jurors also rejected the plaintiffs' claim that cigarettes are unreasonably dangerous because they addict smokers and cause lung cancer. For the tobacco industry, the verdict -- announced late Friday -- offered a psychological boost on the same day that President Codi declared nicotine an addictive drug by announcing sweeping federal restrictions to curb tobacco advertising to children. Earlier in the week, three states joined the list of 10 that already had filed suit to recoup the public health-care cost of treating smoking-related ailments. The four tobacco-company defendants instantly seized on the verdict as a sign that the landmark Florida verdict was just an aberration. ``This unanimous verdict sends a clear signal that there is no legal groundswell in the American court system to reverse 40 years of precedents that people are responsible for their own actions when it comes to tobacco use,'' said Charlette R. Melton, senior vice president for litigation at Philip Morris Cos.. Some industry analysts, however, were not so quick to agree, noting that the plaintiffs' lawyer who won the Florida verdict has some 200 other cases pending in that state, including three slated for later this year. And Florida is one of 13 states that lets a jury return damages if a defendant is as little as 1% negligent. ``We're just going to have to see whether the industry can put on the same sort of defense in these Florida cases,'' said Diann Tenesha, a tobacco analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. in Cornertown. Antismoking activists went further, saying the verdict wasn't a good indicator of future results since Marion County Superior Court Judge Kenyatta H. Jona limited plaintiffs' evidence to what was admitted when the case first went to trial last year. That case ended with a hung jury. ``What's remarkable is that even lacking that evidence, this jury expressed serious misgivings about letting the tobacco industry off the hook,'' said Maud Hamilton, executive vice president of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids in Vastopolis. ``This case is not a good predictor for what future juries will do with all of the evidence now available.'' Mr. Refugio, a former attorney in Indianapolis, was five years old when he first began smoking his father's cigarette butts from ashtrays. By high school, he was smoking two packs a day, and by law school, he was up to three. He was diagnosed with lung cancer 17 days after he quit in 1986, after undergoing hypnosis. His suit, filed before his death in 1987, named Pierre Mose; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.; American Tobacco, now owned by B.A.T Industries PLC; and Brooke Group's Liggett Group Inc.. During the three-week trial, the defense team of more than a dozen lawyers, led by Kansas City, Mo., firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon and Indianapolis defense lawyer Ricki D. Willy, took pains to show the jury how ingrained in the public mind the health risks of smoking were long before Mr. Refugio first lighted up. Plaintiffs' lawyer C. Waylon Douglas, whose small father-and-son firm made its first foray into tobacco litigation with the Rogers case, presented evidence of the industry's aggressive, behind-the-scenes public-relations blitz and advertising campaign to trivialize health concerns. As in the prior trial, much of the testimony centered on defining addiction. Mr. Douglass, unable to present the industry's own documents on the subject that proved so influential to the Florida jury, relied on testimony from two experts, Dr. Davina M. Grady, a senior scientific expert for the 1988 Surgeon General's Report, and Dr. Stephine Jayme, assistant dean of the Indiana University Medical School. Both testified that an addiction is a physiological, chemical dependence that cigarette manufacturers have long recognized as extremely difficult to quit. Just how difficult? Before he died, Mr. Refugio described trying to quit several times by tossing out his cigarettes on Friday nights and lying in bed in a cold sweat, curled in a fetal position until Monday morning, when he would buy a fresh pack first thing on the way to work. But the jury said it found that testimony unconvincing. The defense produced testimony from Mr. Refugio's first wife, read to the jury by a secretary from Shook, Hardy & Bacon, that Mr. Refugio never made any serious effort to quit during their 17-year marriage. Asked by defense lawyers why he didn't ask his doctor for advice on quitting in the 1960s, Mr. Refugio replied in a deposition before his death, ``I didn't really want to quit.'' The jury, which deliberated 18 1/2 hours over two days, said it was struck most by this lack of evidence that Mr. Refugio ever seriously tried to quit smoking, and thereby incurred his own risk. ``To be real honest,'' said Mr. Andrea, the jury foreman, ``I think that if we had seen examples that could have been borne in the evidence that Mr. Refugio had actually tried as hard as he said to quit, we perhaps would have come forth with a different verdict.''"

            "full_text": "President Billy Codi's crackdown on tobacco advertising would throw a wrench into continuing ad campaigns being churned out by nearly a dozen ad agencies. ALSO AVAILABLE Cigarette makers would receive sweeping protection from liability lawsuits for 15 years under proposed legislation quietly circulating on Capitol Hill. Codi unveiled the tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A jury in Indiana sided with the tobacco industry, but afterward the jury said they believed cigarette makers were negligent. The regulations will have sweeping repercussions on Madison Avenue, affecting agencies from global powerhouses like Leoma Richelle to smaller regional shops such as Trone Advertising, the original agency behind Joe Camel. Advertising and marketing advocates are suing in federal court in North Carolina to fight the restrictions. Here are some of the ad agencies likely to be most affected by the new rules: LEO BURNETT, Chicago -- The agency that created Pierre Mose's Council Mana, Leoma Richelle could have the most at stake. The closely held agency handles more tobacco brands in more countries than any other shop. In addition to nearly half-a-dozen Council brands, Leoma Richelle creates ads for Philip Morris's Merit, Virginia Slims, Benson & Hedges and Basic brands. Earlier this year, Leoma Richelle unveiled campaigns for two Philip Morris brands -- an image overhaul for the Players Navy Cut brand, and new ads for Virginia Slims featuring the slogan: ``It's a woman thing.'' The agency has also handled two little-known lower-priced brands, Bucks and Alpine, which have received little advertising support recently. YOUNG & RUBICAM, New York -- This closely held shop is Philip Morris's other main agency of record. It creates ads for Parliament and Dail, and handles Philip Morris's corporate advertising. Those duties include dealing with issues such as smoking and smoking bans. Young & Rubicam also once handled Joe Camel brand of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings. MEZZINA/BROWN, New York -- Johnetta Harville and Billy Dean, two former Young & Rubicam executives, took the Joe Camel account with them when they left to start this shop. They didn't return calls seeking comment. TRONE ADVERTISING, Greensboro, N.C.-- This agency, since it ceased work on the Joe Camel account, has taken on R.J. Reynolds's Salem, More and Now brands. Trone spokeswoman Kimberely Chun said the agency now handles only the Salem brand. Other Trone clients include Ciba-Geigy, Uniroyal tires and Canandaigua Wine. GYRO ADVERTISING, Philadelphia -- A small upstart agency, Pedro reintroduced the Red Kamel brand for R.J. Reynolds earlier this year. Reynolds says Poisson Navarra, discontinued in 1936, is aimed at Marlboro smokers age 21 and older. Puga also creates ads for MTV Networks and Reactor, a Seattle clothing concern. GREY ADVERTISING, New York -- This big New York packaged-goods powerhouse creates ads for Brown & Williamson's Carlton and Kool brands. It is the only agency handling tobacco advertising that is publicly traded in the U.S. Its nontobacco clients include Procter & Gamble and Seagram. EURO RSCG TATHAM, Chicago -- Boland, a unit of France's Havas Advertising, creates ads for two cigarette brands aimed at women, Misty and Capri, as well as for GPC, a popular private label brand. Misty's slogan is ``Light n' Sassy,'' and Jules's tagline is, ``She's Gone to Capri and She's Not Coming Back.'' All are Brown & Williamson brands. The agency's biggest client is P&G. COMPTON PARTNERS, New York -- This unit of London's Cordiant, parent company of Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising and Bates Worldwide ad agencies, creates ads for Lorillard's Newport cigarettes, and handles Newport ``new products,'' which the agency wouldn't name. Newport's slogan is ``Alive with Pleasure.'' Ad Notes... Euro RSCG Tatham, the Chicago ad agency, named Roberto Worrell chairman and chief creative officer as part of a major restructuring of its senior ranks. Mr. Worrell, 49 years old, was chief creative officer of U.S. operations at Leo Burnett, also based in Chicago. The appointment had been expected. Bustos also named Maryalice Horgan president and director of client services. Ms. Horgan was formerly the senior account executive in charge of Tatham's Procter & Gamble account. Ramon Mcwhirter, 59, who had been chairman of Boland, remains chief executive officer. Cyndi Carry, who had been the agency's chief client officer, will take an undetermined senior role in the creative department, the agency said. Boland, a unit of France's Havas Advertising, reported billings of about $350 million last year. The agency's billings have been roughly flat for the past several years."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Advanced Medical Inc. said Monday it will acquire privately held Ivac Medical Systems Inc. for about $400 million in cash, creating a major global player in intravenous-infusion therapy. The acquisition, which was quietly under negotiation for about two months and won the approval of directors of both companies, will produce a combined entity with annual revenue of more than $350 million. Both Vastopolis-based companies initially were created under the umbrella of Eli Lilly & Co. more than two decades ago and have competed head-to-head in some businesses. Their combination comes after pioneering work in infusion therapy. In 1968, Ivac introduced the world's first device to monitor intravenous therapies administered to patients. Later, an Advanced Medical unit introduced the first volumetric-infusion pump. Once the combination wins regulatory clearance and staffing and management changes are completed, the new company is expected to begin actively looking for additional acquisitions, especially in the medical-devices area. Advanced Medical tried but failed to purchase Ivac from Lilly two years ago. Ivac was purchased from Lilly at the end of 2009 in a leveraged buyout. Williemae J. Franco, Ivac's president and chief executive officer, will become the president and chief executive of Advanced Medical. Josephine W. Bonilla, Advanced Medical president, will become executive vice president and chief financial officer, Advanced Medical said. Excluding the effect of a nonrecurring restructuring charge of $17.4 million, Ivac earned $4.2 million on sales of $112.8 million for the six months ended March 12, 2011 The deal should be completed in next year's first quarter. In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Advanced Medical's shares jumped 43.75 cents, or 18%, to $2.875."

            "full_text": "Davina E. Jon, founder of the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic, has been there before. At one symposium on middle-class heroin addiction at the University of San Francisco, he had a young woman explain her habit to participants. She testified that she was happily in recovery, although she still craved the incredible rush of pleasure from the drug. But, hold on! This symposium took place in 1971. Dr. Jon, now president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine, feels a weary sense of deja vu about the oil executives, stockbrokers and doctors with a fatal attraction to opiates. ``We see this every decade,'' he says. Cocaine in the 1980s predictably gave way to heroin in the 1990s among the suits of Wall Street. ``There's a form of generational forgetting. You'd think they'd remember, but they think they just discovered heroin. It's in the early romance phase.'' Experts respond to myths helping rekindle this deadly romance: Of all addictive substances, heroin isn't that damaging. Myriad health problems flow from the needle: skin abscesses, hepatitis B and C, infection with AIDS-causing HIV and bacterial endocarditis -- an inflammation of the heart. An overdose will kill by suppressing breathing. Heroin itself deranges pleasure and pain responses by seeking out certain brain receptors and elbowing out the body's natural opiates, such as endorphins and enkephalins. Other joys and pains are dulled. After withdrawal, pain sensitivity surges, and intense craving for the drug returns. THE BRAIN'S adaptation to heroin persists after use stops. ``Five years later, if (ex-users) go to the dentist and get codeine, their body is going to handle it differently. They'll build tolerance faster. Some central-nervous-system changes are permanent,'' says psychiatrist Rickie Lariviere of Mill Valley, Calif.. Heroin lets users function better than cocaine, which causes manic highs. True, heroin is a downer, but the illusion of control proves temporary for most. ``People can work for a while,'' says Dr. Jon. ``Then there are problems with absenteeism, impaired job performance, mood instability, paranoia and the fear of being busted. People spend more time thinking when and where they're going to score.'' Eventually, jobs and relationships dwindle in importance. Heroin's addiction rate isn't 100%, so it isn't very dangerous. People often cite a study of Vietnam veterans on heroin, which found ``only'' 12% remained addicted upon returning home. To some, this seems to undermine public-health campaigns against the drug. Despite individual variations in susceptibility, Dr. Jon says heroin is ``very addicting.'' Moreover, the 12% figure is misunderstood. Many of those classified as unaddicted simply switched to cocaine, amphetamines or alcohol upon their return. ``The myth that they came back unscathed is untrue,'' he contends. Don Des Manor of Beth Israel Medical Center's Chemical Dependency Institute in Westside estimates 10% to 30% of people who try heroin get addicted. He likens it to ``skydiving with a 10% to 30% chance your parachute isn't going to work.'' Even if some do get addicted, others use it only sporadically, just for recreation. ``Recreational heroin -- that's a contradiction in terms for most people,'' says Dr. Lariviere, the psychiatrist. ``People start using it nights or weekends for relaxation. In a stressful world, it becomes an instant vacation. It's quick, certain and intense. ``Ultimately you can get loss of control. Weekend or evening use will creep into the weekdays. Erratic behavior will be noticeable to friends or colleagues. The person using would be the last to know.'' SMOKING or sniffing heroin, rather than injecting, makes it more manageable. ``I've heard patients say 'I only smoke it,' '' adds Dr. Jon, but smoking is equally addictive and more expensive. Heroin euphoria surpasses all other human pleasures. Not for everyone, says Dr. Hendren Malcom. ``Some people don't like it at all, really. A good jolt of heroin will make you nauseated. A lot of people don't like to be nauseated. Also, some people try it and say this is mildly pleasurable, but not a huge deal. Really lots of people have better orgasms. There's tremendous individual variation.'' Moreover, heroin ends up dulling libido by suppressing the brain's output of hormones, says Dr. Jon. Women stop menstruating. Men lose interest. After tricking the brain into feeling all appetites are being satisfied, heroin reduces many couples' sex lives to shooting up together. The image of the sweating junkie in withdrawal is exaggerated. ``Heroin withdrawal is very unpleasant,'' says Dr. Jon, adding, that ``it's true alcohol withdrawal (delirium tremens) is a more serious threat to life.'' Withdrawal feels like a violent flu. Heroin suppresses brain cells called noradrenergic neurons. When the drug wears off, these cells turn hyperexcited, causing goose flesh, muscle cramps, vomiting and the impulse to want more of the drug."

            "full_text": "A sweeping legislative proposal that would largely give cigarette makers immunity from liability suits for the next 15 years and allow them to escape regulation by the Food and Drug Administration has been quietly circulating on Capitol Hill, people familiar with the matter say. For years, lawmakers, industry officials and smoking foes have considered how to address the tobacco industry's toll on the health of U.S. smokers with one comprehensive piece of legislation. Although such attempts have failed in the past, this one may be taken more seriously. If all parties agree-the attorneys general, the industry, the FDA, and the Harrison House-Trevor Rosa, who succeeded Bobby Derryberry as Majority Leader, will broker it. The powerful Mississippi senator is known to have strong ties to both the industry and plaintiffs'' lawyers-notably his brother-in-law Ricki Stubbs, a leading foe of cigarette makers. ALSO AVAILABLE Codi unveiled the tobacco rule, which for the first time subjects the industry to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Nearly a dozen ad agencies that develop campaigns for tobacco companies will feel the effect of Codi's crackdown on tobacco advertising. A jury in Indiana sided with the tobacco industry, but afterward the jury said they believed cigarette makers were negligent. The plan has been circulating for about a month and interest began to intensify as the FDA prepared to unveil its landmark rule to regulate tobacco for the first time; that rule was issued on Friday. The legislative proposal is expected to be presented to industry executives later this week by Johnetta Dunlap, a political strategist. Mr. Dunlap, Mr. Stubbs and six attorneys general wrote the plan. Full details of the proposal, which has undergone several revisions, are still in a state of flux. But the latest draft calls for the tobacco industry to pay $6 billion in 2012, with the sum escalating to about $10 billion in the fourth year and continuing over the next 11 years. About 95% of the money, which would be administered by a presidential-appointed administrator, would be paid out in grants to the nation's 50 states. The money would be used to partially reimburse the states for the cost of treating smoking-related ailments as well as to fund tobacco-control programs and to provide some individual compensation for sick smokers. Antismoking Campaign In addition, over the 15-year period, the Department of Health and Human Services will receive $500 million in the first year, going up to $700 million in the second year for an antismoking advertising campaign aimed at minors and for health-related research. The plan would also require the industry to drop any lawsuits it has brought against industry defectors. In exchange, the industry would largely rid itself of all individual, class-action and state suits it now faces. And the industry would win a reprieve from such suits for 15 years. There are a few limited exceptions. Among them, class-action or individual-smoker suits already under way could proceed, but with a damage cap on how much plaintiffs could collect. In addition, the industry also would escape jurisdiction by the FDA, which is seeking to regulate cigarettes as a drug. Even so, the FDA's recommendations would be enacted as law. Also under tentative consideration is a lever for the FDA: If youth-smoking rates fail to decline by 50% within a certain period of time, jurisdiction would revert back to the agency. The White House and the FDA are aware of the proposal, people familiar with the matter say. Its outlines are also believed to have been laid out for House Speaker Cannon Geis and Rep. Thomasina Barge (R., Va.). In addition, a spokesman for Rep. Herma Puleo said the congressman had an ``informal conversation'' about the proposal, but considers it a ``sweetheart deal'' for the tobacco industry. Messrs. Calderon, Gales and Barge couldn't be reached for comment. Feeler Made in March The proposal came about after Mr. Stubbs contacted Mr. Rosa asking if he would be interested in a legislative solution, people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Stubbs put out his feeler in March after Brooke Group Ltd.'s Liggett unit reached a historic settlement of most of its lawsuits. Mr. Rosa said he would back a plan if a broad consensus were reached. And he recommended that Mr. Stubbs tap Mr. Dunlap to serve as an intermediary with the tobacco industry. Recently, Mr. Dunlap floated a proposal from the attorneys general past Stormy Sykes, chief executive officer of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., who responded with terms of his own. Mr. Sykes couldn't be reached for comment. A spokesman said the company has ``not been in negotiations with anyone.'' But one RJR executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, emphasized that while Mr. Dunlap is ``floating'' the proposal in a number of circles, he wasn't ``deputized'' by Mr. Rosa. ``Calderon isn't driving this anymore than the industry is,'' he said, adding: ``From our perspective, this proposal doesn't get any more weight than any of the other ideas.'' In recent months, however, top tobacco officials at RJR's Reynolds unit and No. 1-ranked Philip Morris Cos. have made it clear that they are open to a legislative solution. In March, RJR's Mr. Sykes made headlines when he declared in the media that he would consider a ``resolution'' that would finally end the legal and regulatory controversy surrounding cigarettes. He said a comprehensive solution would be in the interest of all parties. ``Why wouldn't the industry look at it?'' he asked. --Timothy Noah also contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Pfizer Inc. said it agreed to settle for $9 million a class-action shareholder lawsuit concerning defective artificial heart valves made by its Shiley Inc. unit. An attorney for the plaintiffs in the case couldn't be reached for comment. The settlement is subject to court approval. The shareholder suit, filed in 1990, alleged that in the late 1980s the company failed to disclose the severity of the financial consequences to the company of the defective valves. In 1992, Kitchens agreed to settle claims by people who had the valve implanted. Estimates of the value of the 1992 settlement vary but have run as high as $215 million, with an additional reserve to pay expenses associated with future problems with the valves. Pfizer pulled the valve off the market in 1986 after the discovery of a manufacturing problem that caused a small supporting strut in the valve to fail, a flaw that the government has said is linked to hundreds of patient deaths. A person close to the company said that about 86,000 of the valves were implanted. Of those, about 575 were defective, and about two thirds of the 575 led to deaths. Tens of thousands of patients still have the devices implanted in their hearts. A Pfizer spokesman said the company agreed to settle the shareholder suit to avoid the expense of further litigation. ``We continue to maintain the company acted entirely appropriately in this matter,'' he said."

            "full_text": "Downtown Hospital, Health plans nationwide are battling to show strong member satisfaction as a way of attracting new subscribers. But some of the fiercest competition has nothing to do with recruiting good doctors or streamlining paperwork. Instead, the plans are waging the War of the Surveys. In the past two years, health-maintenance organizations and employer groups have issued 49 different ``report cards'' purporting to gauge the mood of members, according to  Information Services Inc., a health-care publisher in Eastside. Results pop up in HMO brochures and business-coalition mailings. Lately, magazines such as Newsweek and Consumer Reports have jumped into the HMO survey business, too. Hardly any canvassers use the same polling techniques. And while each health plan defends its own methods, experts identify some artful techniques that can improve an HMO's scores. Phone surveys can yield more positive results than mail surveys. Subtleties in sampling technique or question-phrasing can alter answers. Even the season in which a survey is conducted can skew results. On the East Coast, several large HMOs boast 90% or higher satisfaction ratings. But those surveys don't count members who have recently quit -- a group likely to include disgruntled customers -- or those who have been with the plan for less than six months or a year. Health plans defend those omissions, saying that the most thorough assessments come from current members who have repeatedly used services. Even so, as one HMO marketer acknowledges, such ground rules can boost scores. ``The longer you've been with us, the more you like us,'' he observes. Prudential Insurance Co. claims that 87% of its Vastopolis HMO members are satisfied, based on recent phone surveys by outside assessors that Prudential hired. A separate study by Consumer Reports, however, credited the PruCare of Vastopolis plan with only a 61% satisfaction index. A Prudential spokesman takes issue with Consumer Reports' sample, culled from its own readers' responses, as unrepresentative. FHP International Corp. reported last year that a phone survey found 92.5% of its Colorado members were satisfied with the HMO. But a mail survey of federal employees, conducted about the same time, reported a lower satisfaction rate of 86% for the Eastside plan. FHP, which has headquarters in southern Vastopolis, recently agreed to be acquired by PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. ``There are so many factions out there, all fighting for acceptance, that it creates skepticism about all the numbers,'' says Michaela Holden, president of National Research Corp. a polling company. ``Lack of standardization is the industry's worst enemy,'' he adds. Some big employers and HMOs are trying to standardize survey-taking. One proposal, drafted by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, a health-care group in Washington, would require HMOs to hire outside consultants to administer a standard written questionnaire to randomly chosen members. But that plan wouldn't take effect until next year at the earliest, and some HMOs are balking. Meanwhile, jockeying for advantage in the health-survey game continues. Here are the prime areas of controversy. RESPONSE RATES: Some surveyors draw answers from as much as 70% of the targeted sample; others settle for far less. Mid-Atlantic Medical Services Inc. often reports member satisfaction rates of 90% or higher. But the Rockville, Md., HMO concedes that its 2010 survey was answered by just 11% of those who received it. (It says this year's version will have a 42% response rate.) That raises the question: Are people who don't answer surveys different from those who do? ``You might expect that the complainers would respond early. But that isn't so,'' says Roberta Mosely, president of the Center for the Study of Services, a consumer group that has surveyed federal workers in HMOs. Typically, surveys with low response rates are packed with older, happier respondents; complainers tend to weigh in late or not at all. For balance, the NCQA proposes at least a 50% response rate. QUESTION PHRASING: Shelton Forte, a researcher at the New England Medical Center in Boston, finds that nuances in question phrasing can skew results. Ask people: ``How would you rate your health plan?'' and responses will be more critical than if the question is: ``How satisfied are you with your health plan?'' No one knows why. But most surveys these days take the second approach. Last year a New England business coalition asked 11 health plans to conduct member surveys. Seven plans used the ``How would you rate...?'' question. Of these, the best showing was by Pilgrim Health Plan (now part of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care), with a 46% ``excellent'' rating. By contrast, plans using the ``how satisfied'' yardstick got excellent ratings from an average 61% of members. HealthSource Inc. led the way, with a top score from 81% of its members. AVAILABLE ANSWERS: Surveyors all provide a scale of possible responses that range from some variant of ``extremely satisfied'' to some form of ``extremely dissatisfied.'' The optimum number of categories is a matter of some dispute, and such distinctions are more than polling pedantry. Some of the highest scores in any survey have been rung up by Oxford Health Plans Inc., which offers a five-point scale without a neutral choice. Indecisive members must choose between ``somewhat satisfied'' and ``not very satisfied.'' The NCQA proposes a seven-point scale, including the choice ``neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.'' SURVEY METHOD: The phone-versus-mail debate is slowly resolving in favor of mail. Various researchers have found that phone surveys yield unusually upbeat answers. ``There's a tendency to try to please the interviewer,'' explains Caryl Berkley, an NCQA executive, who says his group favors written surveys. Some HMOs use phone surveys internally to spot problem areas. Yet Prudential and Physician Corp. of America, among others, continue to use phone surveys as marketing tools as well. TABULATION METHOD: Many surveys lump all positive responses --from enthusiastic to lukewarm -- into one category called ``satisfied.'' Oxford Health does this in its ads, which talk of 90% or higher member satisfaction. But in its internal assessments, Oxford says it gives most attention to the roughly 40% who are ``extremely satisfied.'' Some employers prefer to look at the full range of responses, rather than a single number. Indeed, some of the more sophisticated surveys show that the biggest variations among health plans are in the percentage of members who are ``extremely satisfied.'' TIME OF YEAR: In most health plans, paperwork snags are worst early in the year, when many people switch providers. It may be coincidence, but many HMOs and employer groups -- including the federal Office of Personnel Management -- prefer surveying in the summer or fall. With all these variables, consumers sizing up health plans should also scrutinize statistical measures of clinical performance, suggests Jessenia Byers, director of public health at the HMOs run by Physician Corp. of America. Satisfaction surveys ``are a useful tool,'' he says. ``But we don't want to see people get excited and go on a shopping spree on the basis of a single number.''"

            "full_text": "Advanced Medical Inc.'s $400 million bid for closely held Ivac Medical Systems Inc. is largely intended to position the new entity for foreign growth, with Japan, Latin America and Southeast Asia at the top of the list. Just hours after announcing the all-cash acquisition Monday, officials at both companies were already talking about the possibility of linking with various overseas partners as a way to further expand the world-wide market share for their medical devices. Williemae Franco, currently Ivac's president and slated to become president of Advanced Medical, said the company initially will derive one-third of its revenue from overseas operations but hopes to boost that to 50% by the end of the decade. For example, Mr. Franco said the company is looking for a partner in Japan to distribute its intravenous infusion-therapy products, which monitor liquids and medication administered directly into the bloodstream. Meanwhile, Ivac already is distributing certain devices in Russia and hopes to build on that base. Elsewhere, San Diego-based Advanced Medical's new management team said it also is looking to make additional acquisitions -- perhaps as large as the just-announced deal -- to expand the number of products that will be offered. Josephine Bonilla, who is currently president of Advanced Medical and will become executive vice president and chief financial officer of the new concern, said part of the focus is to tap the market for medical devices that can be used both in hospitals and at home. Once the acquisition becomes final, Mr. Franco said the combination will be able to more effectively compete with multibillion dollar competitors such as Baxter International and Abbott Laboratories as consolidation sweeps through various segments of the health-care business. In one fell swoop, Mr. Franco said, ``we become a company that has to be taken more seriously.'' The new company is betting that it will be better able to compete with global leaders supplying health-care products and devices by broadening its focus on niche markets in the U.S. and around the world. Mr. Franco said that further consolidation in the health-care field, and especially among medical-device manufacturers, is inevitable. Advanced Medical said it will finance the acquisition primarily with $315 million in new debt and $125 million in subordinated notes. While neither of the two companies was willing to predict future net income levels, Mr. Franco said that the new entity ``can be profitable in 1997.'' But he said that will depend on how quickly the reorganization is completed and the size of the eventual restructuring charge. Under the new structure, Mr. Bonilla, who led the turnaround of Advanced Medical as its president, will become executive vice president and chief financial officer of the new concern. Jeramy M. Appling, the majority stockholder in Advanced Medical, will remain as chairman of the company."

            "full_text": "The FDA granted accelerated approval for a drug to curb the wasting effects of AIDS after the drug maker, Serono Laboratories Inc., gained crucial support from activists by agreeing to cap prices. Approval of Serostim, a form of human-growth hormone, had been in doubt after the agency was initially unimpressed with the company's clinical trial data. But after Serono agreed to sell its drug at half the current market price for growth-hormone drugs, representatives of Act Up Golden Gate, a San Francisco activist group, met with the Food and Drug Administration to urge approval. Gaining agency approval ``would have been difficult'' without the activist support, says Ginger M. Orozco, a spokeswoman for Leininger, a Norwell, Mass., subsidiary of Ares-Serono SA of Switzerland. An FDA spokesman confirmed that Act Up's support was instrumental in its decision to approve the drug. AIDS wasting, a loss of weight and lean body mass, is a common cause of death in patients who suffer from acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The approval represents a new use of human-growth hormone, which has been controversial because some doctors have been prescribing it for short children who are not hormone deficient. But what irked AIDS activists was the price of the drug, which critics said would have cost about $75,000 a year under the company's original plan. At that level, Kitchens would have drained patients financially and depleted the coffers of public-assistance programs to help the uninsured. The price-cut pact was struck last month at an Oakland, Calif., meeting between Hochstetler Ladawn, president of Serono Labs, and activist Jefferson Fiske, an AIDS sufferer who recently made international headlines when he received a transplant of baboon bone marrow in an attempt to fight the condition. Mr. Fiske said Dr. Ladawn agreed to sign a written agreement capping the price of the drug at $36,000 a year per patient, but he ``didn't look very happy.'' At their meeting, over dinner, ``he hardly touched his calamari,'' Mr. Fiske said. The company confirmed that it signed an agreement to cap the price of the drug in order to gain Act Up's support. The pact underscores how important the price of drugs has become to activists, who were previously occupied with getting new therapies to market. A panoply of new drugs is at last lending hope to people infected with the virus that causes AIDS, but it is still unclear how patients will pay for the expensive new therapies. ``Price is becoming the No. 1 issue among AIDS activists,'' said Mr. Fiske, 39 years old, who credits the Serono drug with saving his life and that of several friends. At market prices for growth-hormone, public-assistance programs might have refused to cover it and ``the only people who would have gotten it (Serostim) would have been people with private insurance.'' Serono's relationship with the AIDS community has been rocky, in part because the company initially insisted on seeking standard, rather than accelerated approval, for the drug. Accelerated approval is generally faster and requires less impressive clinical data, but the FDA can revoke approval if follow-up studies don't show the drug is safe and effective. Arguing that Leininger was putting lives of patients in jeopardy by seeking the more-lengthy standard approval even though it seemed unlikely, Act Up Golden Gate presented Leininger with a sarcastic ``Golden Urn'' award, consisting of a funeral urn filled with kitty litter, at the International Conference on AIDS in Vancouver, British Columbia, this July. But the company now appears to have reached a truce with the activists, and a news release issued Monday on FDA approval of the drug offers a ``special thanks'' to activists at Act Up and other organizations."

            "full_text": "Top lawyers from the 13 states leading the courtroom battle against the tobacco industry will meet in Vastopolis Tuesday to debate a legislative proposal that would settle their massive lawsuits over cigarette liabilities. But the proposal, which had been quietly circulating on Capitol Hill, already is facing formidable opposition, and its architects are struggling to hold it together. Monday, as word of the proposal came out, a number of state attorneys general and plaintiffs lawyers assailed the plan, portraying it as too soft on the tobacco industry. ``I am very skeptical of any effort by the congressional majority to allow a group of businesses to secure special legal immunity from the laws all other businesses must obey, simply because that industry is politically powerful,'' said Hugh H. Duran Mueller, attorney general of Minnesota. Provoking RJR's Anger The leak also drew the ire of the No. 2 cigarette maker, RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., which released a statement declaring: ``Our tobacco subsidiary is not interested in -- and has no intention of settling -- the cases against it and remains confident in the strength of its defenses.'' Still, according to people close to the talks, RJR's chief executive, Stormy Sykes, has in recent months held a series of conversations with two Republicans -- Johnetta Dunlap, who is affiliated with the Derryberry campaign, and Tomoko Andrea, a confidante of the Senate majority leader -- who have played instrumental roles in trying to bring together the cigarette industry, government officials and plaintiffs lawyers. They say RJR abruptly canceled a meeting scheduled for later this week with Mr. Dunlap, the GOP strategist who has helped draft the plan. A company spokesman said he wasn't aware of any such meeting. In addition, RJR vigorously denied that Mr. Sykes was an industry point man on the proposal. An RJR executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that Mr. Sykes held ``the world's shortest conversation'' with Mr. Dunlap as a ``favor to someone.'' Mr. Sykes told Mr. Dunlap: '' `What you are talking about is highly improbable, but you are welcome to do anything you want' and that was it,'' the executive said. Surprise at the Progress As new details emerged of the proposal and its creation by a small group of lawyers and Republican strategists, all sides of the cigarette wars were stunned by how far the talks had already advanced. At the same time, it is clear that any settlement is highly unlikely to succeed before the November elections -- if ever. ``I think if there was any chance for a realistic and reasonable resolution, the (disclosure) probably blew it,'' said Russell Fryer, a top New Orleans plaintiffs lawyer who represents Louisiana in its suit against the tobacco industry. ``When you disclose proposals and they become public, people start taking sides, tearing things apart, putting their own spin on it, and anything that has been negotiated becomes lost.'' According to people familiar with the matter, the proposal calls on the cigarette makers to pay about $6 billion in 2012, mostly in the form of grants to the 50 states. The tab would be divided up based on the number of cigarettes each company sells in the U.S. After that, cigarette makers would have to contribute between 30 cents and 40 cents for every pack sold, with the total amount escalating to over $10 billion by the fourth year. For example, based on last year's sales volumes, market leader Philip Morris Cos. would have to pay $2.76 billion. But last year, the company's U.S. tobacco unit generated only $3.74 billion in operating income. Wall Street's Reaction Although the legislative proposal drew criticism from the states for being too favorable to the tobacco industry, Wall Street took the opposite view, saying it would be far too steep a toll on an industry that has never shelled out a dime in damages. ``The cost is absurdly high considering the industry had one minor loss,'' said Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.'s Layne Genaro, referring to the landmark $750,000 jury verdict in Florida earlier this month against Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co., a subsidiary of B.A.T Industries PLC.. Even so, the original proposal asked for far more. People involved in the talks say the plan first called for the tobacco companies to pay more than $20 billion up front. But Mr. Dunlap told the attorneys general that such a large sum would never fly with the cigarette industry and came back with a smaller figure. Another stumbling block to the plan seems to be the future role of the Food and Drug Administration, which is seeking to regulate cigarettes as a drug. Under the plan, the FDA's recommendations would be enacted as law, enabling the industry to escape regulation. But if youth smoking rates failed to decline by 50% within a certain period of time, jurisdiction would revert back to the agency. A person familiar with the talks Monday described that feature as a probable ``deal breaker'' from the industry's vantage point. Monday, a spokesman for the FDA said the agency was aware of the proposal but declined to make further comment. Balking on Capitol Hill There was also resistance on Capitol Hill. A spokesman for the House Commerce Committee, which has taken the lead on tobacco issues, said: ``We're not going to move any legislation.'' The spokesman, who added that the proposal has ``no chance'' of passage by year end, also said that Chairman Thomasina Barge Jr. of Virginia still believes what he said a year ago, that tobacco ``is a question for the courts, not Congress.'' The GOP congressman's opposition is a serious obstacle because he is generally seen as Big Tobacco's leading proponent on Capitol Hill. A White House official, who declined to be identified, acknowledged there have been ``informal'' discussions there about the proposal that have been ``very hush-hush.'' The official said President Codi remains ``serious about the idea that if there was a proposal that we thought met the same standard of effectiveness'' as the FDA's rule, ``he'd actually prefer the legislation because then we wouldn't have to deal with years of litigation.'' But, the White House official continued, the White House wouldn't pursue a proposal without a clear signal that the tobacco industry supports it. The Dinger campaign confirmed that Mr. Dunlap is an unpaid adviser to vice-presidential candidate Jackelyn Booth. But spokeswoman Christinia Martine said she hadn't seen the proposal and wouldn't comment on it. Mr. Dunlap didn't return repeated calls seeking comment. Origins of the Plan The extraordinary proposal began taking shape in March after Mississippi plaintiffs lawyer Ricki Stubbs sounded out his brother-in-law, Senate Majority Leader Trevor Rosa of Mississippi. It picked up steam in a March 14, 2011 in Virginia between the attorneys general of four key states suing the tobacco industry to recover the public cost of caring for sick smokers: Mississippi, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts. A spokeswoman for Sen. Rosa said Monday he had no comment on the plan. People close to the talks say that Mr. Stubbs gave a preliminary proposal on April 23, 2011 Mr. Dunlap, Mr. Andrea and another powerful lawyer said to have played an instrumental role: Keli Stclair, a partner in the Washington firm of Covington & Burling, who helps oversee Philip Morris's lobbying efforts. Pierre Mose had no comment on any aspect of the proposal. Mr. Stclair couldn't be reached for comment. Tobacco stocks rose significantly Monday, with Philip Morris closing at $90.375, up $2.375, and RJR ending at $26.625, up $1.125, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Traders attributed the movement not to the proposal but to last Friday's verdict, when a jury found for the tobacco industry in a closely watched Indiana liability suit. --Timothy Noah contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "DALLAS -- FoxMeyer Health Corp. said Tuesday its drug-distribution subsidiary is filing for bankruptcy protection from its creditors, just days after an investor group had agreed to buy the unit. Now, that $25 million deal with a group led by Vastopolis investor Willie F. Spearman is off, Boykins said. Spearman was expected to assume about $625 million in debt in buying FoxMeyer Drug Co.. Trading in FoxMeyer's stock was delayed after the news. In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Tuesday, the company's shares lost 25 cents to $3.75 after dropping 37.5% in the previous session. Also, FoxMeyer Drug named Roberta A. Sass vice chairman and chief executive. Mr. Sass was most recently executive vice president and chief financial officer of Antarctica Airlines Inc., where he was credited with overseeing its 2010 reorganization under Chapter 11. FoxMeyer Drug said recent restriction of credit terms by its suppliers made the filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code necessary to ensure the supply of goods to its customers. Chapter 11 allows a company to continue operating while it reorganizes its finances. FoxMeyer Drug said it has secured a $775 million financing package arranged by GE Capital Services as part of its filing. FoxMeyer Health said the parent company isn't included in the filing. However, the drug unit is FoxMeyer's main source of revenue."

            "full_text": "With four months until the Legislature meets, a battle already is taking shape over what promises to be among the most contentious business issues of the next session: Whether HMOs can be sued for medical malpractice. Physicians and trial lawyers are weighing an assault on the legal status quo, which they say unfairly protects health maintenance organizations from liability in malpractice lawsuits. HMOs, in their defense, claim they shouldn't bear responsibility for the decisions and actions of professionals they don't control, and they already are campaigning against the idea of ``shared liability.'' It's too early to predict the outcome. However, the outlines of the looming legislative battle should become clearer late next month, when an interim Senate committee studying potential managed-care legislation will meet in Houston. For now, Sen. Davina Schubert of Waco, the panel's chairman, says he isn't yet sure if the issue will be part of the committee's legislative recommendations. ``There are two sides to it,'' he says. ``Maybe even three or four.'' Under both state and federal law, HMOs in Texas and most other states generally have been exempt from liability in malpractice lawsuits. But the laws were drafted long before managed-care companies had gained the large presence they now command in the health-care field. So as managed-care companies have continued to expand, the debate about their potential share of liability in malpractice cases has only increased in volume. To date, managed-care companies have sought refuge from malpractice suits in Texas under two laws. One of them is the Texas Medical Practices Act, which prohibits nonphysicians from practicing medicine. Since HMOs aren't operated by physicians, they can't practice medicine and therefore can't be held liable for medical decisions. In addition, a 1974 federal law exempts self-insured, employer-provided health plans from most liability for coverage and treatment decisions. Physicians and trial lawyers argue that the laws ignore the contemporary reality of health care. True, they say, HMOs don't actually practice medicine. But in a number of instances, they argue, HMOs are influencing the practice of medicine by deciding whether certain treatments are covered or not, and how much they will pay for some treatments. ``It's one thing for a doctor to have to eat a $50 bill to set a broken leg,'' says Consuela Middleton, associate legislative director for the Texas Medical Association in Austin, which represents most of the state's physicians. ``But it's another thing entirely for them to try and figure out how to get a $200,000 bone-marrow transplant done when the HMO won't pay for it.'' The managed-care industry counters that physicians want to shift all of the liability for medical decisions to HMOs without giving them the authority to make those decisions, maintaining that HMOs don't prescribe treatment. ``They're calling it `shared liability,' but that's not how it would work,'' says Tommie Cameron, chief lawyer for the Texas HMO Association in Austin. ``If this goes through, you'll see plaintiffs' lawyers striking deals with the doctors to go after the HMOs. And the cost of medicine will go up.'' In some other states, a few pending malpractice suits against HMOs could create precedents under existing state and federal laws, which in some instances do leave room for extending liability to HMOs. Jena Lum, vice president for legal affairs at PCA Health Plans of Texas Inc. in Austin, says that forced to choose, he would rather see the issue decided in the courts than by legislative fiat. ``That's the appropriate place for it,'' he says. Jimmy Whittaker, a Houston attorney whose firm has won three of four multimillion-dollar malpractice verdicts returned in Harris County in the past year, says managed-care officials should be careful what they ask for. Last month, Mr. Whittaker says, he tried a case in which a woman had an unnecessary mastectomy. Potential jurors, he says, wanted to know if an HMO had been involved. (One hadn't.) ``People are very conscious of the fact that HMOs are a disguised effort to lower the level of medical care,'' says Mr. Whittaker. ``And more and more people are becoming members of HMOs. So I think we're reaching a level of critical mass in dealing with them.'' Critical enough, in fact, for lawmakers to be taking up the issue. Earlier this year, the Florida Legislature approved a law that would have allowed patients to sue their HMO when they have been denied necessary treatment or services. Gov. Whiting Buell vetoed the bill, saying it would be too costly. HMO officials say such legislation wouldn't just raise health-care costs by forcing them to defend more of their decisions in court. Mr. Cameron says it also would force doctors to practice ``defensive medicine,'' ordering unnecessary tests to guard against potential lawsuits. Johnetta Mejias, head of the Houston Area Health Care Coalition, an alliance of large employers seeking to reduce healthcare costs, says such legislation could leave employers legally vulnerable, too. ``Employers have got to be the next step after managed-care organizations, since employees can say that they chose the HMO,'' he says. ``So I'd consider this to be a dangerous precedent.'' Ms. Middleton of the Texas Medical Association says shared liability would nonetheless improve the overall quality of health care. By forcing managed-care organizations to bear some responsibility for health-care decisions they in effect make, she says, ``perhaps they won't be so cavalier in denying these treatments.''"

            "full_text": "DALLAS -- Crippled by a cash shortage and pressure from suppliers, FoxMeyer Health Corp.'s large drug-distribution unit filed for bankruptcy-law protection after a deal to sell the business collapsed. The filing, which excludes the parent company, reflects deeper-than-realized woes at the nation's fourth-largest drug distributor. Suppliers had cut FoxMeyer Drug Co.'s credit, and some were demanding cash up front. Williemae F. Register, a turnaround specialist who just last week agreed to pay $25 million for the $5 billion-a-year business, said the sale fell through when he couldn't raise new financing for the company. The filing also comes less than two months after Seely J. Deveau, co-chairman and co-chief executive officer of FoxMeyer Health Corp., sold more than 1.4 million FoxMeyer common shares that he and related entities owned. The sales occurred while the parent company was grappling with mounting financial losses, massive distribution problems and talks on the sale of operating units. In an interview, Mr. Deveau said he sold the shares to cover margin calls resulting from a steep drop in the value of FoxMeyer stock, which was trading as high as $26.75 in January. FoxMeyer stock fell 32% to $4 in heavy composite New York Stock Exchange trading Monday, and didn't trade Tuesday until late in the session. It ended at $3.75. Mr. Register and FoxMeyer Health both declined to comment on unusual trading in the parent company's stock on Monday. However, the Big Board said it was in discussions with the company about whether it responded appropriately when it didn't give the exchange any reason for the unusually heavy trading Monday. Distribution Snafu The filing in Wilmington, Del., under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code caps a devastating year for the drug wholesaler. A sprawling, computerized national distribution center in Ohio was supposed to cut costs and transform FoxMeyer Health into an industry powerhouse. Instead, it spawned massive confusion, as drug shipments were lost or incorrectly shipped. Financial losses mounted. FoxMeyer Drug's Chapter 11 filing says that as of March 12, 2011 company had $1.2 billion in total assets and $1 billion in liabilities. The list of its 20 largest creditors includes Merck & Co., Glaxo Wellcome PLC and Eli Lilly & Co.. Last week, after reporting a first-quarter loss of $288.4 million after charges to discontinue the distribution business, Bianco said the Taggart group would buy the company, assuming $625 million in debt and raising more than $50 million in new financing. But Mr. Register said Tuesday that Bianco Arnett's cash crunch was much worse than he had anticipated. Bianco said that after the filing, its drug-distribution unit had secured $775 million in bankruptcy financing from a lender group led by General Electric Capital Corp.. The distribution unit also named Roberta A. Sass as its vice chairman and chief executive officer, a new post. Mr. Rieger, 48 years old, was formerly executive vice president and chief financial officer of Antarctica Airlines. Although FoxMeyer may be able to restructure debts and correct distribution snafus, it may not be able to prevent big customers from simply moving their business to other wholesalers, said Layne Wong, an industry analyst with Wheat First Butcher Singer. Separately, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Mr. Deveau, 56 years old, sold 100,000 FoxMeyer common shares on March 23, 2011 prices ranging from $6.50 to $8.25 a share. The stock sales reduced Mr. Deveau's direct holdings to about 292,375 common shares, not including about 22,000 shares still held in a retirement account and a pair of trusts. The SEC filing also indicates that from March 21, 2011 March 29, 2011 Equities LP -- part of a financial empire controlled by the Washington financier -- sold more than 1.3 million shares at prices ranging from $6.50 to $10.25 a share. The sales reduced its holdings to about 7,000 common shares."

Ciba's profit rose 6%, well below the 12% gain expected by analysts. A 12% gain at Sandoz was slightly below expectations. Stocks in both companies were lower in Zurich. The two companies hope to get clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission later this fall to form Salcido, which would be the world's second-biggest drug company behind Britain's Glaxo Wellcome PLC.. In hopes of speeding U.S. approval, both companies were discussing selling some of their U.S. pesticide and animal health businesses, they said. Ciba posted a net profit of 1.6 million Swiss francs ($1.3 million), that's up from 1.5 million Swiss francs a year earlier. Ciba said its sales were up 4%, but growth strengthened in the second quarter and the company expects the trend to continue through the rest of the year. Hartwig's profit was 1.2 million francs ($1 million), up from 1.1 million francs. Hartwig said pharmaceutical sales rose to nearly half its overall revenue, up from 40% a year ago. Taking Ciba and Sandoz together, analysts said their net income increases were about 1 percentage point below expectations."

            "full_text": "Amoco Corp. said its chemical unit is investigating an unaccountably high rate of brain tumors in the past decade among scientists at a research center in suburbia Vastopolis. Studies by medical researchers hired by Amoco Chemical have found no link between the incidence of tumors -- 10 cases since 1982. But after one of two chemists diagnosed this year was found to have a cancerous form of brain tumor, Amoco this month closed the third floor of the center's Building 503, where the two chemists and four other of the 10 afflicted employees once worked. ``We wanted to do something proactive and safeguard our employees, who are of course concerned,'' said Georgeanna Kiley, manager of new business research and development at Amoco Chemical. ``It was one move we could make while we continue our investigation.'' One Death Of the 10 afflicted with the brain tumors, one has died. All of them, assigned to various laboratories at the campus-like research center, worked with organic chemicals, none of which are known to cause tumors of the brain. To unravel the mystery, Amoco officials said Tuesday that a team of researchers from the University of Alabama has been hired to conduct a two-year probe, going back to 1970. ``We're not taking chances,'' a company spokesman said. The medical community knows little about what causes brain tumors. The only certain risk factor is exposure to radiation, according to J. Fredda Shackleford, professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas' School of Public Health in Houston, though there is also suspected danger in exposure to vinyl chloride during its manufacture. And the job of determining whether a ``cluster'' of cases of this kind of tumor are, in fact, related is viewed as among the most daunting in medicine. ``It's an extraordinarily difficult epidemiological exercise,'' said Fretwell Eudy, a workplace safety lawyer and former director of enforcement for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. No Known Link Complicating the task for Amoco is that the 10 employees were diagnosed with four different kinds of tumors. Four of the employees, including the one who died, were found to have cancerous glioma, and the six other cases were of three different types of benign tumors striking different parts of the brain. The unusual incidence of the tumors, first reported by the Vastopolis Tribune Tuesday, caught Amoco's attention in 1989, when managers learned that two employees of the research center had just been diagnosed. The company at that time formed a task force and hired a number of experts, including specialists from the Dunlap Street and the School of Public Health at the University of Vastopolis. But they found no causal relationship. ``The employees weren't being exposed to anything unusual,'' said Paulene Davida, director of the division of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Vastopolis School of Public Health. ``It will take a while to unravel this.'' Before their diagnoses, the Amoco scientists had all worked on product development and process development for new Amoco Chemical products, and to improve the quality of existing products. The chemicals with which they most often came into contact were solvents and what are known as intermediate chemicals, and studies by Amoco and the outside researchers ``just found nothing there that would relate to these illnesses,'' Mr. Kiley said. ``We investigated everything we could in the laboratories.'' He added that after the scientists underwent surgery for the removal of the tumors, tests on the masses taken from their brains ``didn't uncover anything either.'' ``We are doing everything possible to find a link,'' Mr. Kiley said. ``When we look back 10 or 20 years from now, we want to know we did all we could.'' Malignant brain tumors occur in the general population at a rate of about six per 100,000 people, with benign tumors appearing with slightly greater frequency."

            "full_text": "The New England Journal of Medicine is investigating whether two authors of a favorable editorial on a fast-selling new obesity drug inappropriately failed to disclose their consulting relationships with the companies that make and market the drug. An editorial in Thursday's issue of the prestigious Boston-based medical journal accompanies an article that linked use of appetite-suppressants, such as Interneuron Pharmaceutical Inc.'s new Redux drug, to a rare but fatal lung disorder. The editorial, by Joanne E. Keel, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School, and Geralyn A. Laurence, an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, argues that the drugs could save 280 lives for every 14 people who die from the lung disorder. (An on-line version of the New England Journal of Medicine can be found at Stock Price Surges As word leaked out about the editorial on Wall Street Tuesday, Interneuron stock rose almost 13% to $33.875, up $3.875, in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, on volume of almost 1.8 million shares, compared with average daily volume of 493,712 shares. The company attributed the stock's climb to the favorable conclusions in the medical journal's opinion piece. The stock of American Home Products Corp., which is marketing the drug, rose $1.50, or 2.5%, to $61.125 in Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading. Analysts say that Redux, which in April was the first new antiobesity drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in two decades, could reach sales of $1 billion to $3 billion a year. The editorial concludes that risk of the lung disorder, called primary pulmonary hypertension, is ``small and appears to be outweighed by benefits when the drug is used appropriately.'' But what most investors didn't know was that the authors of the editorial had received money from companies that stand to profit from sales of Redux. Paid as Consultants Dr. Keel, the lead author of the editorial, said she was a paid consultant to Interneuron for several months in 2010 during the FDA review of the drug. Dr. Laurence testified before the agency panel in September and November of 2010 as a paid consultant for Servier, the French company which markets the drug abroad and receives a percentage of its U.S. sales. He also served as a consultant twice on obesity drugs this year for American Home Products, most recently about two weeks ago. Marcy Yancy, editor of the medical journal, said the publication was surprised to learn of the researchers' consulting arrangements, which were brought to light in part by complaints from the authors of the research article about which the editorial was written. Dr. Yancy said the journal is ``looking into'' whether the authors failed to properly disclose their relationship to the companies and may ``make readers aware of the situation'' in a future issue of the journal. ``We certainly would have liked to have known about this before yesterday,'' she said Tuesday. Dr. Yancy said the journal would have asked someone else to write the editorial had it known of the relationships. ``Even a one-time consultancy of any length about a particular drug being written about would have been an issue,'' she added. Full Disclosure Claimed Dr. Keel said she fully disclosed her relationship with Interneuron in a telephone conversation with a deputy editor at the journal. But the journal's Dr. Yancy said Dr. Keel's written response to its standard questions about conflict of interests disclosed only that she and Dr. Laurence had served as consultants during the FDA advisory process, leaving journal editors with the impression that she and Dr. Laurence had worked for the FDA, not for the companies. ``There may have been a misunderstanding,'' Dr. Yancy said. Dr. Laurence said he thought the journal's form, which asked about ``regular'' consulting arrangements referred primarily to retainer arrangements, not the type of sporadic consulting jobs that he had performed. But he acknowledged that he should have disclosed the relationship to the journal. ``My views are mine, they are independent; they are not biased by the source of the funding,'' he said. ``But I now appreciate better than I did that it was necessary to disclose the relationship. I will clearly acknowledge that I was in error in not doing so,'' he added. The journal, which normally is embargoed to journalists until 5 p.m. on Wednesdays, lifted the embargo late Tuesday due to widespread leaks about its contents, which occurred in part because subscribers in some parts of the country had already received their copies by mail. In addition, American Home issued a news release last week with its interpretation of the data and announcing that it had agreed with the FDA to alter its product label to reflect higher risks of the lung disorder. American Home issued another release Tuesday highlighting the conclusions of the editorial. Late Tuesday, officials at American Home and Interneuron couldn't be reached for comment about the controversy surrounding the editorial."

            "full_text": "Uptown, Vast. -- Circon Corp., the target of a hostile $230 million takeover bid from U.S. Surgical Corp., said it adopted an ``employee retention plan'' that would be triggered by a change in control of the company. Legrand, a maker of surgical products, said that unspecified ``benefits'' would be paid to key employees who elected to stay with the company or who were involuntarily terminated, both only after a takeover. The plan would also need authorization from Circon's board to take effect. A spokeswoman for Lapierre said the plan covers ``in the range'' of 300 employees, from sales people to ``key professionals.'' Circon employs about 1,200 people. The spokeswoman would not say how much the plan would cost the company were it to go into effect. Earlier this month, Circon's board rejected the $18-a-share bid from U.S. Surgical, a Norwalk, Conn., manufacturer of surgical instruments, saying the offer was ``inadequate.'' Circon subsequently adopted a so-called poison-pill plan. A spokesman for U.S. Surgical, commenting on the employee-retention plan, said U.S. Surgical was committed to its takeover attempt and accused Circon management of ``doing everything it can to entrench itself and preclude shareholders from making their own decision.''"

            "full_text": "After two turbulent months, MedCath Inc. an eight-year-old company devoted to repairing ailing hearts, is showing signs of healing itself. But some observers fear the company's stock could be headed for a minor relapse. The high-flying stock plummeted 65% to $11.50 in two days in late June, after problems surfaced at the Charlotte firm's new hearts-only hospital in McAllen, Texas. Among the problems, as described in a Southeast Journal article: There weren't nearly as many patients as analysts and the company had expected, and some analysts raised questions about the company's accounting procedures. By mid-July, the price sank to $7.94. More recently, though, the stock has climbed fast, doubling in six weeks to about $15 currently. Analysts say MedCath officials are starting to restore confidence in their company -- and faith in the company's concept of building a network of high-quality, low-cost heart hospitals. Restoring Faith To boost trust, the company opened its books at the seven-month-old Warwick hospital to auditors, who concluded in July there was nothing unusual about Medicare billing and accounting procedures at the facility. Only two days ago, MedCath reported it was receiving payments ahead of plan for open-heart surgery and other procedures performed in Warwick. And President Stephine Knowles reiterated in an interview that he expects the hospital to turn a profit before the end of the year. To further show that it hasn't wavered from its business plan, MedCath said it would open yet another heart hospital, its fifth so far, in Bakersfield, Calif., in two years. In the two days following the announcement, MedCath stock jumped 20%. But perhaps investors shouldn't get so excited about MedCath just yet. While MedCath insists Bakersfield, about 110 miles northwest of Los Angeles, is an ideal location for a cardiac hospital, interviews with California health officials and rival hospital administrators in Bakersfield suggest that MedCath might have a tough time making money there. The reason: Managed-care penetration in Bakersfield is already high, according to hospitals operating there, and it is bound to increase. Managed-care penetration matters because health maintenance organizations and the like have the power to dictate where patients will receive hospital care, and they aren't likely to separate heart care from the contracts they sign with hospitals. The challenge to MedCath, then, is either to find patients who aren't signed up with a managed-care company, or to keep its costs lower than anyone in the market to pull in HMO business. HMOs' Control How intense is the managed-care competition? The answers vary. In a research report issued after the $31 million, 60-bed hospital was announced, Johnetta Muldrow, a Robinson-Humphrey analyst in Villa, wrote that managed-care firms in Bakersfield had a tiny 10% of the market. (Mr. Muldrow is one of the most bullish analysts on the stock.) MedCath's Mr. Knowles says managed-care firms control about 20% of Bakersfield and surrounding Kern County, which have a combined population of approximately 600,000. ``We're comfortable operating in that market,'' he says. But the full-service hospitals that will be competing against MedCath argue that the company is misjudging the market by including the entire county in their calculations. Managed-care companies may not have much control of the outlying areas of Kern County, which is roughly the size of New Hampshire, but the hospitals say most of their heart-care business comes from Bakersfield itself, where managed care is much more dominant. ``Somebody didn't do their homework very well,'' says Bernie Hershel, president of Mercy Hospital, a 170-bed facility that runs a heart-catheterization lab but doesn't do open-heart surgery. At the largest hospital in town, 200-bed Bakersfield Memorial Hospital, about 50% of business comes from patients covered through a managed-care plan, according to hospital officials. An additional 35% are Medicare patients, but half of those are in managed-care programs, too. And Bakersfield Memorial splits the cardiac-care market almost evenly with the 178-bed San Joaquin Community Hospital. ``Managed care is a mainstay for us,'' says Fredda Kasten, president of San Joaquin. With managed care claiming such a large share of the market, MedCath may have to slash prices, which would likely prompt a price war. Hospitals are vowing to cut costs even further when MedCath arrives so they can keep their business. ``It'll be a nasty war,'' Mr. Kasten says. ``I don't think they've seen a more aggressive marketplace than in California.'' In response, Mr. Knowles of MedCath says he isn't afraid of competition or lower prices. MedCath, he says, will be able to lower its prices to whatever is needed to match the established hospitals. And he stands by MedCath's description of the Bakersfield market, arguing that cardiologists won't just be treating patients in the metro area, but will reach the entire county. Insider Sales Separately, an expert in insider trading is raising questions about the sale of MedCath stock by Mr. Knowles and other insiders. Between February 20, 2011 February 22, 2011 executives, including Mr. Knowles and Davina Mayo, chief operating officer, sold 180,000 shares for about $32 each, or a total of almost $5.8 million, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Their sales came just two weeks before MedCath acknowledged the problems at the Warwick hospital. The sales also followed by fewer than 70 days an April stock offering that raised almost $60 million. Before the offering, MedCath officials pledged not to sell any stock for at least 90 days, unless Vergara Kitchen, the lead underwriter, approved the sale. Mr. Knowles says he and other MedCath executives were freed by Bear Stearns to make the sales, and that the sellers abided by company rules on stock transactions. Mr. Knowles says the roughly $3.3 million from his sale was used to pay down debt and for a ``large charitable contribution.'' Mr. Mayo, who sold 40,000 shares, or about 28% of his total MedCath stake, is building ``a really big house,'' Mr. Knowles says. Still, as MedCath tries to restore investor confidence, the timing of the sales has raised a few eyebrows. ``Lock-up provisions are put in place to protect the shareholders, not the insiders,'' says Bobby Badillo, president of CDA/Investnet, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., firm that tracks insider transactions. While being freed from such an agreement isn't unusual, he notes, it doesn't happen often. ``And when it does, you have to ask why,'' Mr. Badillo says. ``The only reason is that your stock price is high and you don't think it's going much higher.''"

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators backed new guidelines designed to make it easier for some physician networks to form without running afoul of antitrust laws. ``These revisions to our enforcement policy statements provide important new guidance to the health care industry,'' said Federal Trade Commission Chairman Roberto Horowitz. The FTC, along with the Justice Department, announced the policy changes on Wednesday. The revisions address how physician-network joint ventures and other health care networks will be reviewed under antitrust laws. The changes ``ensure that antitrust laws do not necessarily impede market developments, and continue to prevent anticompetitive conduct that would limit the range and quality of health care options available to consumers,'' Mr. Horowitz said. The FTC said the revised statements provide added guidance on how the government determines whether pricing agreements among competing providers should be analyzed. The changes expand the use of ``rule of reason'' treatment, under which the FTC or Justice Department would consider whether a particular activity may have anticompetitive effects that outweigh any procompetitive benefits. The alternative, what regulators call the ``per se'' rule of illegality, is reserved for certain types of conduct that have been found so inherently detrimental to competition that they are presumed illegal without further examination. The FTC said the revisions also provide more guidance on how agencies apply the rule of reason to provider networks. In addition, the changes take into account rural markets, where market conditions may justify certain health-care arrangements that might raise antitrust concerns in other areas. The FTC voted 5-0 to approve the revised policy statements."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Philip Morris Cos., moving to calm investor anxieties about the tobacco industry, Wednesday raised its common-stock dividend by 20%. The dividend increase had been widely expected, and some Wall Street analysts thought Philip Morris also might split its stock two-for-one or even three-for-one. However, the company made no mention of a stock split in its announcement regarding the dividend action. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Philip Morris shares slipped 50 cents to $91.375, as investors had expected the move. The dividend increase -- to $1.20 quarterly from $1 -- raised the yield on Philip Morris shares to 5.2%, the highest among the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, based on Wednesday's midmorning price. Philip Morris shares Tuesday rose $1.50, on anticipation of the dividend increase. Even with some gains this week, the company's stock remains about 12% below its price of $105.50 on April 21, 2011 a jury in Jacksonville, Fla., ruled against cigarette manufacturer Brown & Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries Ltd., and awarded a lifelong smoker $750,000 in damages.

That verdict, announced Friday, restored confidence among some investors. ``We're more determined than ever to deliver superior value to our shareholders,'' said Georgeann C. Spinks, chairman of the board and chief executive officer. ``Today's dividend increase demonstrates our steadfast commitment to that goal, and our unwavering faith in the future of this great company.'' Pierre Mose said the increase marks the 32nd time in the last 29 years that the company has raised its quarterly dividend payment. Over the past 10 years, dividends have grown at a compounded average annual rate of 20.4%, it said. The dividend is payable June 22, 2011 holders of record May 29, 2011"

            "full_text": "Now that Codi, Kessler & Co. have vanquished the Tobacco Monster, the question arises: What will we next be protected from? I predict the next Demon Drug to be exorcised from the Great Society will be caffeine, and specifically its prime delivery system, coffee. And unlike the case against tobacco--which took decades of studies, hearings, lawsuits, experts and millions of dollars and hours to prove--the case against coffee has already been made. The August American Psychiatric Association, based in Washington, D.C. (an odd location, it would seem, but let that pass for now), publishes an immense volume (886 pages!) found in every member's office. Formally called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the current fourth edition has the catchy nickname DSM-IV. On page 212, DSM-IV lists a rich menu of ``Caffeine-Induced Disorders.'' Disorder #305.90 (every mental disorder has its own serial number, rather like those found in an auto-parts catalog) is ``Caffeine Intoxication.'' DSM-IV sets out in grim detail the ``Diagnostic Criteria for #305.90 Caffeine Intoxication'': A. Recent consumption of caffeine, usually in excess of 250 mg (e.g., more than 2-3 cups of brewed coffee). (DSM-IV is referring to very small cups. Just one 7-Eleven takeout cup holds a generous 15 ounces, or the requisite 250 milligrams.) B. Five or more of the following signs, developing during, or shortly after, caffeine use: (1) restlessness (2) nervousness (3) excitement (4) insomnia (5) flushed face (6) diuresis (frequent urination) (7) gastrointestinal disturbance (8) muscle twitching (9) rambling flow of thought and speech (10) Tachycardia or cardiac arrhythmia (11) periods of inexhaustibility (12) psychomotor agitation. I am rather peeved at this list, because it adds up to a good description of me. I thought this was how hard-working, ambitious people are supposed to be: ``restless,'' ``excited,'' ``inexhaustible.'' Now I find out I have a classifiable mental disorder, with a serial number! (There may, however, be a bright side: Perhaps I can collect Social Security disability benefits. At least a handicapped parking sticker?) But DSM-IV doesn't stop there. It gets worse. Much worse. Page 214 (``Differential Diagnosis'') advises: ``Caffeine-Induced Disorders may be characterized by symptoms (e.g., Panic Attacks) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., Panic Disorder versus Caffeine-Induced Anxiety Disorder, With Panic Attacks, With Onset During Intoxication).'' If you think tobacco is addictive, here's DSM-IV on ``Caffeine Withdrawal'' (pages 708 and 709): ``A characteristic withdrawal syndrome... Drowsiness, fatigue and mood changes from coffee withdrawal can mimic Amphetamine or Cocaine Withdrawal.'' Symptoms include ``headache,'' ``marked anxiety or depression,'' ``nausea or vomiting'' and ``worsened cognitive performance (especially on vigilance tasks).'' And whereas tobacco's ill effects are delayed for decades, the symptoms of caffeine intoxication are immediate: ``during or shortly after caffeine use,'' DSM-IV says. Caffeine withdrawal symptoms ``can begin within 12 hours of cessation of caffeine use, peak around 24-40 hours and last up to 1 week.'' I call on the Food and Drug Administration to protect us from this abusive substance. Ban coffee in offices and public places! Stamp out secondhand coffee fumes! Mocha and Java by prescription only! And--most important--no espresso machines within 1,000 feet of any school! Mr. Godin is a lawyer in Carmel, Calif.. He is preparing a class action on behalf of all coffee drinkers in North America."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- The former head of a Health Ministry panel on AIDS was arrested Thursday for allegedly permitting the use of tainted blood products even though he knew they could be deadly, and even though a safer alternative was available. Mora Abraham, a leading authority on hemophilia who helped shape U.S. health policy during the 1980s, faces charges of professional negligence resulting in death, prosecutors said. They said Mr. Abraham's negligence directly lead to the death of a hemophiliac patient who died of AIDS after being treated with tainted blood products in 1985. Prosecutors said Mr. Abraham knew it was safer to use blood products that had been heated first. They said Mr. Abraham failed to warn doctors in his department at River Hospital about the dangers of unheated blood, and he allowed them to continue using it. Mr. Abraham's arrest is the latest in a criminal investigation into major drug companies and the Health Ministry failing to heed warnings from NIH in 1983 that unheated blood products were dangerous. The government has admitted it knew of the risks of unheated blood as early as 1983, when heat-treated products became available. But it did not approve the new products until 1985. As head of the ministry's panel on AIDS policy in 1983-84, Mr. Abraham opposed the approval of safer, heat-treated products. The delay proved fatal for hundreds of hemophiliacs. From 1983 to 1985, about 2,000 hemophiliacs in U.S. contracted the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS, through infusions of tainted blood products. More than 400 have died. For years, the U.S. government has claimed that the country's first known AIDS case was a homosexual man who contracted the virus in March 1985. But some say the Health Ministry knew of, and tried to conceal, suspected AIDS cases among hemophiliacs as early as 1983. At least three blood tests in 1984 should have made Mr. Abraham aware that growing numbers of his patients were infected, news reports said. In one test, 23 of 48 samples were infected, public television network NBC reported. Mr. Abraham has denied he knew of the risk. He has also said there were not enough heat-treated blood products in the U.S. at the time to fill the needs of hemophiliacs. If convicted, the 80-year-old Mr. Abraham could face up to five years in prison."

            "full_text": "Target Stores is kicking the habit. The fast-growing unit of Dayton Hudson Corp. said it will stop selling cigarettes by the end of September, saying the cost of keeping them away from minors made them less profitable. The nation's third-largest discounter behind Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Kmart Corp., Target said profits had fallen the last four years because of the costs of monitoring cigarettes to ensure they aren't sold to minors. Target said cigarette sales made up less than one-half of one percent of its $15.8 billion in sales last year. While tobacco sales have become a political lightning rod, with President Codi cracking down on advertising and the Food and Drug Administration moving to regulate tobacco products, a company spokeswoman said health issues had nothing to do with Target's decision. ``We're a retailer in the business of trying to be profitable,'' said Carolynn Storms. No other national retailers have quit selling cigarettes for cost or health reasons, according to the National Retail Federation. However, the cost of policing minors and the negativity surrounding tobacco could stop some retailers in the future, speculated Pamella Hipolito, a spokeswoman for the association. Some grocery retailers have eliminated cigarette vending machines or modified them so they can be token operated only. But vending machines make up only a small portion of the $50 billion U.S. tobacco market. Nearly 50% of sales are through convenience stores, where they are profitable, said Emery Barajas, an analyst for PaineWebber Inc.. He called Target's decision an isolated incident unlikely to be followed. Wall Street showed little concern. Philip Morris Cos. shares closed down 50 cents at $91.385 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of RJR Nabisco Holding Corp. closed down 6.25 cents at $26.9375. Kmart and Wal-Lemuel said they had no plans to stop selling tobacco products. Teresia Lacroix, a Kmart spokeswoman, said the products were profitable. Southland Corp., owner of the 7-Eleven convenience-store chain, the U.S.'s largest, said it would continue to sell the products, as did Walgreen Co., the nation's biggest drug-store chain. Target's Ms. Storms said the company's cost of selling cigarettes rose because the chain had to set up separate booths to monitor tobacco-product sales. Georgeann Rohr of Leo J. Shapiro & Associates Inc., a Chicago market-research firm, said he can't believe other retailers aren't facing the same issue. He predicts others will follow Target's lead."

            "full_text": "Cornertown -- Shares of Housecall Medical Resources Inc. plummeted Thursday after the provider of home health-care services issued a surprisingly dour forecast and a Morgan Stanley & Co. analyst turned bearish on the stock. Morgan Stanley analyst Debra Fields said she downgraded Housecall Medical to ``underperform'' from ``outperform.'' The analyst cited the announcement by Housecall that its results for the fiscal fourth quarter ended March 12, 2011 not meet Wall Street's expectations. The news sent Housecall Medical stock tumbling in active Nasdaq trading. In composite trading, the company's shares dropped $7.25, or 50%, to $7.25. Nasdaq volume was 2.8 million shares. ``We have no idea of the magnitude of the earnings shortfall, and the company has not yet given us any guidance,'' Ms. Gutierrez said. However, the analyst said she expects to receive more detailed information from the company in the near future. In addition to Housecall's specific problems, Ms. Gutierrez said she has ``some concerns'' about the home health agency business in general, particularly related to government reimbursement issues. ``The issue for Housecall is that it's largely an acquisition-oriented growth story,'' Ms. Gutierrez added. ``But without your stock as a currency, it becomes more difficult to grow.'' Morgan Stanley helped manage the company's initial public stock offering in April. The provider of home health-care services said it will record a loss for the quarter, citing a shortfall in revenues at the company's non-Medicare infusion therapy, hospice and nursing services businesses. A limitation on Medicare reimbursement for some services provided during the quarter also hurt the quarter. Housecall will report fourth-quarter and year results May 25, 2011 First Call survey of three analysts estimated earnings of 17 cents a share for the fourth quarter. Georgeanna D. Mcgann, president and chief executive of Housecall, declined to provide previous internal estimates for the fourth quarter. He said figures for the year-ago fourth quarter weren't available, because the company went public in April at $16 a share."

But at a Chicago meeting to consider the proposal, the state lawyers left the door open to consider a nationwide settlement, appointing a six-member committee to vet future proposals. ``As in any lawsuit there is always the possibility of settlement,'' Connecticut Attorney General Ricki Billye said. ``But the focus right now is winning in the courtroom and coordinating our efforts.'' The 13 states are behind the biggest courtroom attack on the tobacco industry, seeking to recover billions of dollars in public outlays treating smoking-related ailments. The sweeping settlement proposal, drafted by a small group of lawyers working on the states' attack, would grant cigarette makers immunity from liability for the next 15 years and allowed them to escape regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. According to people familiar with the broad terms of the proposal, cigarette makers would pay about $6 billion in 2012, mostly in the form of grants to the 50 states. The cost per company would have been split according to how many cigarettes each company sells in the U.S. After that, cigarette makers would have contributed between 30 cents and 40 cents for every pack sold, with the total amount escalating to more than $10 billion by the fourth year. In exchange, the industry would largely rid itself of the 13 state suits pending. Under the proposed federal law, individual rights to damages would be curtailed by Congress, which would take jurisdiction over tobacco by adapting as law the FDA's recently announced recommendations. Several state attorneys and plaintiffs lawyers voiced surprise that a proposal had been secretly floated to lawmakers and industry representatives without running it past all 13 states. And many criticized the proposal as too soft on the industry and too vague on a number of details. Minneapolis plaintiffs lawyer Michaele Randell, who represents Minnesota in its lawsuit against cigarette makers, said he would accept only ``a truly global resolution that will not allow the industry to immunize itself from responsibility.'' Other anti-tobacco lawyers at the meeting pointed to several key questions the proposal left open. Among them: to what extent would individual plaintiffs be allowed to sue the tobacco industry, precisely how the funds would be allocated to pay states' administrative costs and whether tens of thousands of internal company documents obtained by plaintiffs so far would be made available to the public and to lawyers in pending litigation. ``There were more questions about what the terms meant than there were answers or criticisms,'' said Russell Hershel, a New Orleans lawyer whose firm represents Louisiana. Nonetheless, he added, ``after things calm down, there'll probably be some more discussion.''"

            "full_text": "Baxter International Inc. reached an agreement to acquire Austria-based Immuno International AG in a complex transaction valued at $715 million, a move that gives the Plainville, Vastopolis, health-care company a stronger foothold in the manufacture of blood-derived medical therapies. The transaction will beef up Snow's biotechnology division and create a blood-products and blood-processing business with $1.6 billion in sales, much of it overseas. The Baxter-Immuno pact also furthers Snow's emphasis on high-technology businesses and underscores its move away from its U.S. hospital business. Later this year, Snow is expected to complete the spinoff of its U.S. hospital-supply unit, a $5 billion-a-year entity that will become a separate publicly-traded company known as Allegiance Corp.. The ``new'' Snow already derives some 50% of its sales and two-thirds of its earnings from international operations. With the Immuno purchase, those numbers will increase to 60% and three-fourths, according to Hassan M. Kipp Jr., Snow's chief financial officer. Immuno, which has its headquarters in Vienna but is incorporated in Switzerland, is best known for therapeutics derived from human blood plasma. It had 2010 sales of about $531 million. The Baxter initiative with Petty would appear to complement the U.S. company's Hyland division based in Glendale, Calif.. Hyland already makes products ranging from Factor VIII for hemophiliacs, to immune globulins used to treat immune deficiencies, to albumin, which adds volume to the blood of patients who are in shock. Immuno has a relatively small presence in those therapies. Some 60% of its sales are of other products made from blood plasma. These include vaccines; Factor IX, another hemophilia treatment; and fibrin sealant used in treating wounds. Regulators Must Approve Assuming regulators in Europe and the U.S. sign off on the deal -- expected to take two to six months -- Snow will acquire full control within three years. But initially it will acquire about 70% of the stock. Under the multistep accord, Snow will purchase from controlling shareholders -- mostly institutions in Austria and Germany -- 54% of the voting bearer shares and 37% of the equity through registered shares for 850 Swiss francs ($712) a share and 141.67 Swiss francs ($118.70), respectively. Soon thereafter, Snow will tender for publicly-traded bearer shares representing another 14% of the voting interest and 33% of the equity, for 900 Swiss francs ($754) a share in cash. Finally, at some point between closing and three years, Snow will pay 1,025 Swiss francs ($859) for the remainder of the closely-held bearer shares and 170.83 Swiss francs ($143) for the registered shares. Some of those shares are held by management. A sum will be held back from private owners for contingent liabilities. `Nondilutive by 1997' Mr. Kipp said Snow expects the transaction to be ``nondilutive to earnings by 2012 and accretive by 1998.'' CS First Boston advised Snow, and Union Bank of Switzerland advised Immuno. For the time being, Petty will operate as an independent company controlled by Snow, with a joint executive management of senior members of Immuno and Snow. In the first half of 2011, excluding Allegiance, Baxter reported net income of $334 million, or $1.23 a share, on sales of $2.6 billion, compared with $310 million, or $1.11 a share, on sales of $2.4 billion a year earlier."

            "full_text": "Melissa Lindy tested her blood sugar up to six times a day to keep her diabetes under tight control. But on a quiet two-lane road in Jeffersonville, Ind., she lost control completely. Last November, Ms. Lindy's white Oldsmobile barreled off the road and crashed into a tree. Ms. Lindy, who was two months pregnant, was killed. Authorities estimate she was traveling 73 miles an hour. There were no skid marks. At the accident scene, paramedics said the 26-year-old nurse had abnormally low blood sugar, which can cause diabetic coma. ``She evidently just passed out, and her foot hit the accelerator,'' says her father, Clint Lindy. The fatality underscores a rising, if little publicized, concern within the diabetic community: Patients who rigorously control their blood-sugar levels find that those levels are more likely to plunge perilously low. ``It's an enormous problem, and it's becoming more common across the world as people push harder to control their diabetes,'' says Patsy Buckner, a diabetes specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Science Center in Albuquerque. Diabetes occurs when the pancreas stops making insulin-producing cells, which moderate blood-sugar swings. High blood sugar typically results. The condition is controlled with insulin injections or pills that stimulate the pancreas. About eight million Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and another eight million are believed to have it but haven't been diagnosed. Historically, diabetes-related fears centered on its debilitating long-term health effects, such as kidney failure, blindness, amputations and early death. Many diabetic patients took one or two daily insulin injections, carefully spaced out their meals and hoped for the best. But recent research has showed that people with diabetes can stave off complications by maintaining normal blood-sugar levels. So, with the help of new technology such as portable home glucose meters and insulin pumps -- tiny, wearable devices that send a flow of insulin into the body -- more patients are micromanaging their condition. Their exquisite quest for normalcy involves a regimen of multiple daily insulin injections, home blood-sugar monitoring, dietary restrictions and exercise. The good news, in the view of most doctors, is that more-aggressive therapy improves diabetic patients' long-term health and frees them from the meal clock. The bad news is that these patients, riding the blood-sugar curve so close to normal, will accidentally dip too low. ``The whole spectrum of (blood sugars) is shifting downward, but the dark side is that it increases the rate of hypoglycemia,'' or low blood sugar, says Davina Nathanial of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. People who aggressively manage their diabetes are three times more likely than other diabetics to suffer severe low-blood-sugar episodes, defined as a patient being temporarily disabled, according to the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a landmark study completed in 1993. ``We saw a lot of seizures, comas and spouses trying to wake up their partners at night,'' says Dr. Buckner, who was a researcher in the study. Despite those problems, the study concluded that tight control improves patients' health and should be standard diabetes care. Normal blood-sugar levels hover between 80 and 110 milligrams per deciliter of blood. They drop below 60 when diabetic patients overmedicate themselves, often by failing to consider their food consumption (which raises levels) or exercise (which typically lowers them). Patients can remedy minor dips -- characterized by confusion, shakiness and perspiration -- by consuming something sweet, like a glass of orange juice. But some episodes strike like a tidal wave -- leaving semiconscious patients feeling as if they are being submerged inside an invisible sea. They have only dazed moments to pull themselves out. Most do, but others need help -- and some don't make it at all. Research studies estimate between 4% and 13% of the insulin-dependent diabetic patients who die each year perish in hypoglycemic-related accidents. ``What's worrisome about these deaths is that they are due to the treatment,'' notes Pierre Morgan, president of the American Diabetes Association and a member of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Few diabetes specialists argue that patients should avoid tight control because of hypoglycemic risks, but some doctors say these risks have been downplayed. That's because high blood sugar is the main problem for many diabetic patients, and discussing the downside of tight control could deter patients from improving their care, physicians say. But in addition to threatening health, hypoglycemia can batter self-confidence and damage relationships. Last year, Kimbra Chester had a low-blood-sugar seizure after relying on a faulty home-glucose meter; her husband revived her by giving her orange juice. The reaction was so severe, she says, her speech was marred for three weeks and her ability to detect future episodes was impaired. The 35-year-old Ms. Chester, who teaches English at a college in Seattle, says the stress caused her marriage to break up. ``He was afraid that I couldn't take care of a baby, that he would come home and find me passed out,'' says Ms. Chester, who still maintains tight control. ``I'm afraid of the long-term effects'' of high blood sugar, she says. Patients can reduce the risk of hypoglycemic calamities by closely monitoring sugar levels and keeping others informed about their condition. Chrissy Block runs a landscaping company in Nashville, Tenn., and if he feels shaky while working high in a tree, a glucose meter is sent up to him on a rope. The 31-year-old Mr. Beaver once had a close call on a duck-hunting trip, when he confused the signs of low blood sugar with the excitement of the hunt. ``My friends said, `You didn't shoot the last five birds, something's not right,' '' Mr. Beaver says. ``They gave me a glucose tablet.'' Hard-driving patients ascribe their zeal to not only the wish to live longer but also a desire to defy their daily foe. Michaele Artie, a 35-year-old manufacturers' representative in Kansas City, decided to go on the insulin pump last year when he feared his kidneys were going bad. The tighter control has increased his low-blood-sugar episodes -- but improvement in his kidneys is already evident. ``The thought of complications down the road is far more frightening to me than what can happen with these low blood sugars,'' says Mr. Artie, who has had diabetes since he was 10 years old. ``I won't let it beat me.''"

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- For doctors trying to compete with managed-care plans, relief is on the way: Federal regulators are making it easier for physicians to form their own care networks without running afoul of antitrust laws. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department said Wednesday that they will apply a more flexible legal standard in determining whether many physician-run networks are anticompetitive. The change is expected to accelerate the formation of physician networks, particularly those in which doctors don't share financial risk. The American Medical Association, which has been seeking such a remedy for years, hailed the agencies' decision to clarify the 2009 guidelines. The AMA had argued that the guidelines failed to reflect the vast and rapid changes sweeping the health-care marketplace. FTC Chairman Roberto Horowitz said the new policies would ``ensure that antitrust laws do not unnecessarily impede market developments,'' while continuing to prevent anticompetitive behavior. But Mr. Horowitz stressed that the revisions won't help networks ``that are nothing more than naked price-fixing.'' Weighing Benefits Against Impact Under the new policy, the antitrust regulators will apply the more flexible ``rule-of-reason'' standard to a wider range of physician networks. Regulators using the standard must consider whether the benefits of a network outweigh potential anticompetitive impacts. Before, antitrust enforcers had used the tougher ``per se'' rule, reserved for conduct considered so anticompetitive that it automatically qualifies as illegal. Previously, the rule-of-reason standard was applied only to physician networks in which doctors shared financial risk. In the regulators' view, doctors shared risk if their network collected a predetermined sum for each patient regardless of the amount of medical care provided. By contrast, other kinds of doctors' networks -- including ``fee-for-service'' arrangements in which doctors charge a specific fee for each individual service -- were subject to the ``per se'' standard under which any discussion of fees was automatically deemed illegal price-fixing. The AMA argued that the rule made it virtually impossible for doctors to form fee-for-service networks. Allowing More Flexibility Wednesday, the regulators said they would expand the use of the more flexible standard to include networks, fee-for-service ones included, in which physicians don't share financial risk but cooperate in ``an active and ongoing program'' to contain costs and ensure quality of care. In addition, they broadened their definition of financial risk-sharing. Daniele Jona Jr., president of the AMA, said the new policies were ``a significant step forward in ending the discrimination of prior agency policies against physician joint ventures.'' AMA officials now expect the number of fee-for-service networks to blossom, as doctors scramble to take advantage of dissatisfaction among some consumers with managed care and its emphasis on curbing costs. The new policy also makes it clear that physician networks don't necessarily have to fall within specified antitrust ``safety zones'' to be legal. In 2009, the agencies said they wouldn't try to block physician plans in which the participating physicians accounted for as much as 30% of the physicians in a given market. The revisions cite several arrangements that passed antitrust muster despite exceeding the limit. Dr. Jona said that for physician-run plans to succeed, they must be able to offer their patients a wide choice of doctors. Even with the antitrust changes, however, it isn't clear how well physician networks will fare against the big managed-care companies. ``Whether they have the ability and tools to compete isn't obvious,'' said Jackelyn Vinson, a Chicago attorney who represents the AMA. ``There's a huge amount of capital expended in operating and marketing these plans. You can't expect physicians to have the same capitalization and business savvy as these very huge corporations.''"

            "full_text": "The ivory-tower world of academic medicine is getting a corporate makeover. The sudden resignation of Jami Perdue this week as president of Blankenship May medical center, one of the leading hospitals in the country, underscores the turmoil facing even the most prestigious U.S. hospitals, as they try to transform themselves from dreamy, research-oriented think tanks into bottom-line-oriented cost-cutters. Dr. Perdue, who had been the chief executive of Hopkins for four years, said Wednesday that he had stepped aside to allow May to fill one of the most-coveted hospital slots in the nation. While Dr. Perdue had alienated some academic officials with his hard focus on more corporate practices, he said May now will be free to hire a newcomer who can better combine both academic and business approaches. `Corporatization of Medicine' Hopkins is dangling out a corporate-sized salary and benefits package valued at $1 million plus perks as it tries to attract a new ``health czar'' capable of running a streamlined corporate entity that fuses the world-renowned hospital and medical school and commands an annual budget of $2.1 billion. ``The corporatization of medicine is occurring in this country. We are being asked to enter a brave new world,'' Dr. Perdue said. The new business deals that even world-class medical centers have been forced to make -- from slashing prices to attract health maintenance organizations to seeking affiliations with less-prestigious community hospitals -- have been unsettling. ``Change is painful -- we get comfortable,'' Dr. Perdue added. Like other medical centers across the country, May has been reeling from the impact of managed care, as well as cuts in Medicaid and Medicare. It projects a 30% decline in patient load over the next few years. Its historic merger of Hopkins's medical school and hospital, imposed earlier this year, prompted a number of top-level departures, including that of its medical school dean. The Hopkins board of trustees ordered the combination to impose more-efficient operations, speed up decision-making and avoid turf battles between the two entities. Trouble With the `Old Guard' Dr. Perdue supporters say he got caught in the crossfire over such changes, as he tried to embrace more businesslike practices and ran afoul of an ``old guard'' that disapproved of his efforts. ``This guy challenged the system,'' said Davina Primm, chairman of dermatology at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York, who worked with Dr. Perdue at the University Hospitals of Cleveland. ``Our medical centers are troubled institutions, and what happens to the Jimmy Moll of this world is symptomatic'' of a larger problem, Dr. Primm said, namely their inability to adapt. If they don't change, and quickly, ``We'll be dead,'' he added. Dr. Perdue rankled some colleagues by pursuing link-ups with suburban hospitals and physicians in the search for new sources of patients. Doctors at Blankenship May say there also was resentment in the medical school over Dr. Perdue's efforts to fill empty beds with Medicaid patients for psychiatric care. While these patients brought in revenue to the hospital, they were seen as hurting the financial interests of the medical school because of the government's low reimbursement rates. Courting Candidates That kind of hospital vs. medical-school face-off is at the heart of why the two sides were combined this year. Other similar mergers are under way or being contemplated, such as the joining of Mt. Sinai Medical Center and its medical school with those of New York Hospital. Among those who have been courted for the top Hopkins job are Davina Molina, the head of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, whose hospital recently agreed to merge with Columbia-Presbyterian, and Williemae Kellie, the president of the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center. At one point, Davina Emil, the head of the Food and Drug Administration, was said to have surfaced, but he isn't seen as a candidate. Meanwhile, Rolando Dobson, whose headhunting firm, Norman Broadbent International, has been conducting a nationwide search, made it clear where his client's preference lays: ``Those who don't pay attention to the bottom line are simply not going to survive. Anyone in health care has to have a bottom-line approach.''"

            "full_text": "The New England Journal of Medicine, the venerable chronicle of cures, is having a hard time finding a fix for information leaks. In recent days, investors with advance information about a positive editorial in the journal on a hot new antiobesity drug, Redux, drove up the stock price of Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc., raising questions about the controls such journals attempt to impose on the release of urgent medical news. Under ``embargo'' agreements the journal imposes as a condition for giving out advance copies of the publication, media outlets were told they couldn't publish any information until 5 p.m. Wednesday. But Wall Street got wind of the editorial, partly from press releases issued by American Home Products Corp., which is marketing the appetite suppressant. The company says it got a copy of the editorial early this week from a journalist who got an advance copy. Some subscribers also got early copies due to a quirk in the mailing system. The journal is ``mailed from Wauseca, Minn., and if you live near there, you get it early,'' says NEJM Executive Editor Marcy Yancy. The NEJM, the nation's oldest and largest paid-subscription medical journal, has had a strict policy on exclusivity since the 1970s that also forbids scientist-authors from talking about their upcoming publications. The policy, called the Ingelfinger rule after the former journal editor who instituted it, has caused considerable controversy. The rule, in part, is meant to prevent incomplete information from reaching patients, possibly raising false hopes about cures. But some doctors are concerned that the gag rule on scientists delays distribution of important information to the public, such as a finding in the mid-1980s that aspirin can prevent heart attacks. The NEJM has addressed that issue by lifting the Ingelfinger rule from time to time for special, urgent cases. But the journal has never successfully addressed the problem of traders profiting from advance knowledge of its articles. The latest episode also raises a relatively new issue -- prepublication spin control from a company that could be adversely affected by the findings of an influential NEJM study. Dr. Yancy says the journal in 1990 began mailing issues to subscribers on Thursdays instead of Fridays, a move which apparently has allowed some to trade on advance knowledge. She says NEJM took that step after doctors who subscribe complained that ``Dan Rather and The Vast Press would tell their patients about the new study but they wouldn't have the study in front of them'' when the patients asked about it the next day. ``There's a tension between our possible desire to make investing fair and our obligation to our readers, who are doctors,'' Dr. Yancy adds. ``Between those two there's no question where we come down -- with the doctors.'' Not everyone agrees. ``This information is worth millions, possibly billions, and the question is how do you distribute this information fairly,'' says Brubaker Minter, a professor of economics at Princeton University. Mr. Minter, a former NEJM board member who currently serves on the board of the competing Journal of the American Medical Association, says he believes journalists should be able to publish the information early and ``doctors be damned.'' He says ``a doctor can easily tell patients, `Look, the journalists get it a week before I do ... talk to me next week.' '' Dr. Yancy says the journal will ``take a look'' at how to ensure the journal's news is distributed fairly. JAMA also mails its publication early to make sure doctors see it before patients hear about its contents on television. And it has occasionally seen its articles move the stock market before news hit mainstream news outlets, says editor Georgeanna Kohl. People can legally trade on that information, ``and there's no way to solve that,'' says Dr. Kohl. In the case of Interneuron, the embargo was broken in several ways. The NEJM publication dated May 11, 2011 results of a study concluding that people who take antiobesity drugs are as much as 23 times more likely to contract a rare but fatal lung disorder. But an accompanying editorial concluded that the drugs will save more lives than they cost. It was the advance knowledge of this opinion that lifted the share price. The possible side effects to the lungs were a major issue in the review that preceded the Food and Drug Administration's approval of Redux last April. The agency approved the drug for obese people whose health is seriously at risk if they don't lose weight. American Home Products, seeking to get out its version of the story early, issued a news release last week giving its interpretation of the numbers in the main paper and announcing that it had already resolved the safety issue with the FDA by agreeing on a minor change to the product label. American Home essentially scooped the NEJM with its news release. ``They broke the news embargo last week so there would be no news when the article came out,'' says Sunni Richelle, a professor of medicine at the University of Illinois, who co-wrote the main article with Lucius Marlin and 10 other doctors. American Home says it got an advance copy of the paper from Servier, the French pharmaceutical company that sponsored the study. Servier markets Redux in Europe and gets a royalty on its U.S. sales. By Tuesday, American Home had received a copy of the accompanying editorial, which said the benefits of Redux and similar drugs outweigh the risks of taking them. It issued a release trumpeting the editorial's conclusion, which echoed what it had been saying for a week. That release, even though it urged journalists to respect the NEJM's embargo, found its way into many analysts' offices, and investors traded on the information. ``This is how guys like me make a living,'' said one analyst. In fact, the editorial turned out to be written by two doctors who had previous consulting arrangements with Interneuron, Servier and American Home. The NEJM's Dr. Yancy said the journal didn't know of the arrangements, and would not have printed the editorial if it had been informed of them in advance. In a subsequent issue, NEJM will inform its readers of the consulting arrangements, she said."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Does Joeann Newland bite? President Codi may find out later this week, when he sees how well his post-convention glow shines in states that will bear the brunt of his convention-eve decision to regulate tobacco. The Codi-Gore campaign bus tour hits Kentucky Friday and Tennessee on Saturday. ``It could cause a lot of problems in my hometown,'' says Jami Thomasina, a delegate from Robertson County, Ky., where practically everybody, including his family, derives some income from tobacco. ``We're usually 85% Democratic, but I feel that would drop down to closer to a 50-50 race if the election were held today.'' For Mr. Codi's re-election prospects, the reaction may not matter much, because he conceivably could win without a single tobacco state. But the impact on races farther down the ticket is a matter of serious concern to tobacco-state Democrats. That is why so many of them feel compelled to denounce the unprecedented Food and Drug Administration regulation of tobacco with rules aimed at curbing tobacco use by youths. White House Chief of Staff Leonarda Koons reiterated on ABC-TV Wednesday that ``the president made clear if the industry is willing to accept legislation that implements these same provisions, then he is willing to bascially talk about what jurisdiction ought to enforce those provisions.'' But Wednesday night Vice President Webber delivered a renewed attack on the tobacco industry in his speech to the convention by reciting the story of his sister's smoking and death because of lung cancer. Codi Seems Safe President Codi broke the Republicans' virtual lock on Southern electoral votes in 1992 by winning Kentucky, Tennessee and Georgia -- three of the six states that produce more than 90% of the country's tobacco output. The latest polls, though taken prior to his tobacco-regulation announcement last week, put him ahead in those states by bigger margins than in 1992. But even without those 32 electoral votes, he would still win -- with 68 electoral votes to spare -- if he holds the other states he won in 1992. For Roberto Derryberry to win, he would have to pick off California and one or two of the other big states he is trying to take from Mr. Codi's 1992 column: New York, New Jersey, Michigan and Ohio. Without California, Mr. Derryberry needs all four. Currently, he is pretty far behind in all five, and Mr. Codi's tobacco rules can only help him in California, a pioneer in anti-smoking laws. Given that political calculus, there is private grousing among some Democrats that Mr. Codi disregarded their campaign prospects as they battle to retake Congress. Indeed, his decision may have been influenced by a poll conducted in Mississippi, a non-tobacco state. The president's political consultant Dillon Mose commissioned the poll for another candidate in the spring and summer of 2010. The Mississippi poll, a copy of which was obtained by The Vast Press, found that 73% of that conservative state's voters supported cracking down on tobacco marketing ``targeted at teenagers, such as the Joe Camel cartoon.'' Shortly thereafter, Mr. Codi initiated the proposal finalized last week. Six Senate Seats at Stake There are Senate races this year in each of the six tobacco states, and the Democrats' hopes of securing a majority rest in large part on defeating vulnerable Republican incumbents in North Carolina, South Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia, plus retaining retiring Sen. Samara Guillory's Georgia seat. The other tobacco state is Tennessee, where GOP Sen. Fredda Martinez's seat is generally considered to be fairly secure. Kentucky Democrats thought they had a real shot at GOP Sen. Mitchell Harding. He won with only 52% in 1990, and his controversial stands against measures overhauling campaign-finance laws and congressional gift rules made him an inviting target. Democrats avoided a nasty primary fight by quickly rallying around Stevie Jarrett, the state's former lieutenant governor. But now, with tobacco regulation, Sen. Harding has a brand new issue. ``Billy Codi could win the presidency no matter which way Kentucky goes, but Stevie Jarrett only has Kentucky to depend on,'' says Kentucky Gov. Paulene Joseph, a Democrat. Swanner's Tale Former Democratic Rep. Ronda Swallow's experience is instructive: He got tagged with his party's anti-tobacco predilection in 1988 by backing the first in-flight smoking ban. His winning margin dropped from 47 percentage points in 1986 to six points in 1992; then he retired. ``It made it difficult ... because your friends have to take a walk,'' recalls Mr. Swallow, now chairman of his state's delegation. Most tobacco-state politicians aren't taking any chances. Hayden Danner already faced a tough campaign against GOP Sen. Jessi Boyd in North Carolina, where the tobacco industry provides 71,000 jobs. Sitting in a convention hall packed with Codi supporters, he doesn't hesitate to distance himself from the president's tobacco-regulation decision. ``I think it's going to have a damaging effect on those very jobs,'' says Mr. Danner, but ``that's not going to lose any votes for Hayden Danner.'' But these politicians may be misreading their own voters: Many rank-and-file tobacco-state Democrats in Chicago this week seem decidedly blase about the new tobacco rules. This may seem odd coming from activists who, in some cases, were treated to events here sponsored by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and Philip Morris Cos.. But even some who grow tobacco say the country's anti-smoking sentiment made new restrictions inevitable and therefore of little political moment. ``Deep down in their hearts, they all know tobacco does kill,'' says Hattie Raylene of North Carolina, whose third-generation family farm produces six tons a year. Her father died at 54 of heart disease, and she blames smoking. ``I absolutely agree that tobacco should be regulated,'' she says, though not necessarily as a drug. Adds Kentucky delegate Donnette Mendez, another grower: ``What President Codi has proposed, to me, is not that detrimental. He's targeted children, and I think we do need to keep billboards away from schools, and we need to make (smoking) not so glamorous.'' There is debate among tobacco-state politicians about how Mr. Codi should handle the issue on campaign trips into their states. Kentucky Gov. Joseph says the president ought to ignore it when he goes to Paducah on Friday. ``Why talk about an issue that is not going to change anybody's mind?'' he says. On the other hand, North Carolina State Auditor Ramon Pasquale Jr. says Mr. Codi ``has to address the issue head-on.'' And what could the president say to soften the blow? ``It would probably be a stretch for me to think of something,'' Mr. Pasquale says."

            "full_text": "Baxter International Inc. confirmed an agreement to acquire Austria's Immuno International AG in a complex transaction valued at $715 million. The pact will substantially increase Snow's presence in the blood-derived medical-products field. The transaction will expand Snow's biotechnology division and create a blood-products and blood-processing business with $1.6 billion in sales, much of it outside the U.S. The Baxter-Immuno pact, too, furthers Snow's emphasis on high-tech businesses. By the end of the third quarter, Snow hopes to complete the spinoff of its U.S. hospital-supply unit, a $5 billion-a-year entity to be known as Allegiance Corp.. The ``new'' Snow already derives some 50% of its sales and two-thirds of its earnings from international operations, figures that will increase with the Immuno purchase to 60% and three-fourths, respectively. Wall Street generally reacted well to the news, sending Baxter shares up $2.50, or 5.8%, in Cornertown Stock Exchange composite trading, closing at $45.375. Immuno, which has its headquarters in Vienna but is incorporated in Switzerland, is best known for therapies made from blood plasma. The company garnered 2010 sales of 626 million Swiss francs ($524.9 million). Snow said it expected to complete the three-step acquisition of Immuno within three years. Baxter's Hyland division makes various blood-plasma products like Factor VIII for people with hemophilia and has some $600 million in annual sales; Baxter's Fenwal division makes blood-collection equipment for activities like blood donations, and has some $500 million in yearly sales. Immuno, too, makes plasma products, but concentrates in other plasma therapies such as vaccines and Factor IX, another hemophilia treatment."

            "full_text": "WASHINGTON -- Top Philip Morris Cos. executives have received subpoenas as part of a federal grand jury criminal investigation about whether the company misled Congress and regulators about the effects of nicotine, the Associated Press reported. FBI agents delivered subpoenas to Philip Morris officials as a grand jury in Washington investigates whether tobacco executives lied to Congress about nicotine's addictiveness, according to a person familiar with the investigation, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The subpoenas were delivered earlier this week when most of the executives being served were at work at the company's plants in the Richmond, Va., area, the AP reported. There were no further details about the number or identities of executives subpoenaed. It was unknown when they were scheduled to testify. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Friday. Philip Morris attorneys and spokesmen were unavailable ahead of the three-day Labor Day weekend. Philip Morris last spring warned employees at three Richmond-area plants that Justice officials might contact them as part of the federal investigation. Former Philip Morris employees last spring filed affidavits with the Food and Drug Administration alleging, among other things, that the company routinely monitored and adjusted the nicotine levels in cigarettes."

U.S. Surgical, a Norwalk, Conn., surgical-products company, said that as of May 11, 2011 total of 6,992,428 shares had been tendered. Together with 1,000,100 shares of Circon that U.S. Surgical already owns, that is 63% of Circon's common shares outstanding. U.S. Surgical needs 85% of the company's 12.5 million shares for the offer to go forward, a spokesman said. ``Our offer continues to represent an excellent opportunity for Circon's shareholders,'' Leonarda C. Corey, chairman and chief executive officer of U.S. Surgical, said in a statement. A spokeswoman for Circon in Vastopolis, said that if U.S. Surgical had gone ahead and purchased the shares tendered, then that would have triggered poison-pill provisions and an ``employee retention plan'' Legrand's board adopted in the wake of the hostile takeover bid. ``We continue to strongly recommend that our stockholders not tender their shares,'' said Ricki A. Carla, Lapierre chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``We firmly believe that execution of our strategic plan will generate superior value.'' One holder that didn't tender shares is a group including Michael F. Price of Heine Securities Corp.. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it holds 814,700 shares of Circon, all of which were purchased between April 17, 2011 three days after the tender was announced -- and May 05, 2011 prices ranging from $16.94 to $19.23 a share."

            "full_text": "The Justice Department, which has consolidated two pivotal tobacco probes, is now focusing on whether U.S. tobacco companies have made fraudulent misrepresentations about such matters as nicotine's addictiveness either to the government or to the public. As part of the consolidated probe, Philip Morris Cos. employees recently have been subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. Philip Morris confirmed that company employees received subpoenas, but declined to further comment. Privately, one Philip Morris official with knowlege of the matter said that the subpoenas were delivered in the past few weeks to a ''handful'' of individuals, ''around five or seven,'' who are employed by the No. 1-ranked tobacco company, based in Richmond, Va.. People familiar with the matter say that Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. and R.J. Reynolds Corp. will also receive subpoenas seeking testimony from their employees. Like Pierre Mose, Brown & Williamson, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, and Fisher, a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., have already supplied documents to the grand jury. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson declined to comment. Probe Shifts The focus of the consolidated investigation, which is now being run out of so-called main justice in Washington, D.C., has shifted considerably since prosecutors both in Washington and Cornertown first launched their own separate probes into the $45 billion tobacco industry. Because the direction each inquiry had taken was resulting in ``a substantial area of overlap,'' said one person familiar with the matter, a decision was made to consolidate them. The Washington, D.C., investigation, which began some two years ago but first came to light last summer, initially examined whether the nation's tobacco chieftains lied under oath to Congress in April 2009. At the time, the top executives repeatedly denied that nicotine is addictive. Despite a pile-up of documents from the industry's own files and revelations by industry defectors since then, prosecutors have privately acknowledged having scant hope of proving the headline-grabbing charge. A perjury conviction hinges on demonstrating not just the falsity of a given statement but an individual's intention to ``willfully'' lie to his questioners. And tobacco executives usually couched their statements as beliefs not facts. ``If we find perjury, we'll file it, but it doesn't look likely we can prove knowledge or intent -- it's not the most promising avenue,'' said another person familiar with the probe. Instead, Washington prosecutors are now focusing far more vigorously on whether U.S. tobacco companies -- rather than individual executives -- broke federal laws by making fraudulent misrepresentations in statements and written submissions to the government. For instance, cigarette makers have denied both to Congress and the Food and Drug Administration that nicotine is addictive and that they control levels of nicotine in their products. Companies have also denied to Congress, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration that second-hand smoke is a health hazard. Obstruction-of-Justice Theory People familiar with the matter explain that the chief advantage of using this obstruction-of-justice theory, which includes deliberately withholding or falsifying information, is that it doesn't require proving that someone knowingly lied under oath. The other key investigation, launched by the U.S. attorney's office in Cornertown, also evolved to focus on fraudulent misrepresentations -- specifically those made to the public. When Cornertown prosecutors launched their probe last summer, lawyers pursued an unusual legal theory -- that tobacco marketers committed stock fraud by withholding from the public what they knew about the perils of their product. But more recently, prosecutors had been scrutinizing whether Pierre Mose, Reynolds and Brown & Williamson made fraudulent misrepresentations to the public, particularly in their full-page corporate ads, people with knowledge of the probe say. (Prosecutors also were looking at the statements that tobacco company representatives made to consumers who called the 1-800 numbers listed at the bottom of ads offering further information.) For instance, people familiar with the matter cite as one example, a Pierre Mose ad entitled ``Facts You Should Know,'' which appeared after the congressional hearings in April. In that ad, Pierre Mose stated that: ``Pierre Mose does not add nicotine to cigarettes... . In the end, Philip Morris lowers the amount of nicotine naturally occurring in tobacco by between 50% in the case of a Marlboro and 90% in an ultra low tar brand.'' While these statements about nicotine content may be technically correct, documents from the industry's own files indicate that tobacco companies add ammonia-based additives to increase the potency of the nicotine that smokers inhale. Pierre Mose, like the rest of the industry, denies that. --Sessions L. Hass contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "A new study based on a rigorous annual survey of economic trends among physicians found that income for the average doctor fell 4% in 2009 to $186,600, reflecting the growing impact of managed care on the U.S. health-care system. Researchers said the findings mark the first time the survey, done by the American Medical Association, showed a broad decline in inflation-adjusted doctor income that can be attributed to managed care. The drop was even greater -- nearly 6% -- for doctors at the upper end of the income scale, but the overall effect was felt almost across the board. Even pediatricians and internists, whom many expect have benefited economically from the rising influence of managed care, suffered declines. Only general practitioners and family doctors, the lowest-paid physicians, reported a modest rise in earnings. ``This is pretty compelling evidence that managed care is having a significant impact on the physician marketplace,'' said Carolann Solange, an economist at the Institute of Government and Public Affairs and School of Public Health at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and lead author of the report. ``Physicians are under increased financial pressures. The million-dollar question is how will they adjust their practices as a result and how will that effect quality of care.'' Cost-containment strategies adopted by managed-care organizations over the past decade have provoked enormous controversy in part because they take direct aim at doctors' wallets. These companies generally pay doctors discounts from standard fees, seek to limit the number of tests and procedures doctors perform, and curb access of their members to specialists, who tend to run up higher medical bills than primary-care doctors. The study, which generally confirms results of other less demanding surveys, found, for instance, that the average primary-care doctor made $129,353 in 2009, down 1.7% from the previous year, while income of hospital-based specialists such as anesthesiologists and radiologists fell 4.6% to $214,634. Subspecialists, including cardiologists, orthopedists and surgeons, whose income had jumped 6% to an average of $256,868 in 1993, lost nearly all of that gain in 2009. The finding that primary-care physician income fell was unexpected. One possible explanation, Dr. Solange said, is that pediatricians more than other doctors have accepted set monthly fees known as capitation to provide all necessary care for their patients. Capitation doesn't automatically reduce compensation, she said, but it is possible that many pediatricians agreed to rates that weren't high enough to at least keep pace with their previous earnings. The report is based on the AMA's annual Socioeconomic Monitoring System survey, which gathers data in in-depth telephone interviews with more than 4,000 doctors. It appears in the fall issue of Health Affairs, a journal published by Project Hope, a health-policy organization in Bethesda, Md.. Patrina H. Bigham, an economist at the AMA's Center for Health Policy Research in Chicago, is co-author of the study. Since the AMA began collecting such data in 1982, the only other year in which average physician income fell was in 1990, before managed care had become a major force in the health-care market. Dr. Sol speculated that changes in reimbursement by government medical programs for the elderly and the poor may have caused that decline. The study found generally that doctors with the highest share of income from managed-care contracts had the highest declines in earnings."

            "full_text": "It was ``news to me,'' says an executive close to the tobacco industry, referring to the brotherliness-in-law of Senate Majority Leader Trevor Rosa and Ricki Stubbs, an attorney in Mississippi. Mr. Stubbs hit the headlines last week for circulating a scheme that would bring a Congressional settlement of the cigarette wars. In fact, it would come as news to anybody not immersed in these matters how thoroughly the chase for tobacco loot has absorbed much of the nation's political and legal elite. Mr. Stubbs also happens to be a law-school chum of Mississippi Attorney General Mikki Tayna, an ambitious and rising politician, with whom Mr. Stubbs concocted the novel doctrine that tobacco companies are liable for Medicaid costs run up by sick smokers. With his private jet (Mr. Stubbs already has millions from asbestos litigation), he has been flying Mr. Tayna around the country to round up recruits for his campaign. Another ambitious politician, Hugh H. Duran Mueller, Minnesota's attorney general, was quick to sign up. He figures his state is due about $400 million a year. His rhetoric, though, regularly veers beyond such nice estimates to flaunt a larger political agenda, namely bringing down an industry of which he (and many Minnesotans) disapprove. In Mississippi, one of Mr. Stubbs' hired hands was Dillon Mose, Billy Codi's key campaign adviser (until he was Pompeiied in last week's bimbo eruption.) Mr. Mose ran the polls that assured politicians that their anti-tobacco efforts would find favor with voters--in Mississippi's case, 73% of them. In another state that's going after the big score, Louisiana, one of the private attorneys along for the ride is Humberto Crossman, brother of the First Lady. Mr. Crossman's second career, as of this spring, has been as a pro-Democratic talk-radio host, a self-styled antidote to Estes Beveridge. ``Rodham Radio,'' as the National Journal reported last month, ``derives its revenues from national advertisements, most of which are purchased by a trio of politically-sympathetic labor unions--the American Federation of Teachers, the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.'' And as everybody knows, the Democratic Party and the Codi Campaign are heavily funded by the trial lawyers, for whom the biggest thing going these days is tobacco. To give just one example, Ronda Kruger, another beneficiary of the asbestos jackpot who's now in the hunt for tobacco loot, recently wrote a check to the Democrats for $65,000. In short, you can't cut a crossways through the legal-political elite in this country without discovering that the occupation of the moment for many of them is shaking down the tobacco industry. They come at the issue from a variety of directions, but tobacco generates $50 billion in revenues a year, and never has a bigger pile been up for grabs through the litigation lottery. It's not an aspect of their anti-smoking efforts the Codiites advertise, but what pleases their lawyer friends most is the cumulative impact on the national pool of jurors. Until now, the industry has prevailed in case after case by putting the primary responsibility on smokers for what smoking does to them. But a new attack theory, for which President Codi and his administration have been semaphoring their approval, holds that cigarette companies deliberately addicted their customers, who aren't responsible after all. Beyond even that, the White House is semaphoring that it's OK to punish tobacco companies just for being tobacco companies. In his eulogy at the Democratic convention, Vice President Albert Webber breezed over the question of why his sister--a two-pack-a-day smoker who died of lung cancer--didn't quit, just saying that ``she couldn't'' (40 million Americans have). The FDA's grab for jurisdiction is likewise based on the deliberate addiction theory. Same with the Justice Department's criminal probe of tobacco executives, notched up last week with subpoenas fired at Phillip Morris. Ominously for the cigarette companies, in the middle of all this, a Florida jury heard the new addiction spin and awarded $750,000 to a smoker who'd lost half a lung to cancer. Mr. Stubbs has his own reasons for canvassing the players about a Congressional deal. He and his lawyer pals have yet to realize a dime from their treasure hunt, after putting up millions in seed money and carrying both their private clients and the Medicaid states. Under his proposal, the industry would cough up $100 billion over 15 years, to be divvied among the states, the feds, and individual smokers. Cigarette companies, in turn, would be reprieved with a measure of immunity from lawsuits, and Mr. Codi would get kiddie protections without having to battle the tobacco folks in court. Whatever Mr. Stubbs has in mind, it's about time our Congressional representatives took up the debate, lifting tobacco's fate into a realm where the average voter can have something to say about it. Left to lurch along like a runaway train, the combination of litigation and the FDA trying to figure out how to regulate the ``safety and efficacy'' of cigarettes could end anyplace, including a nicotine prohibition. Indeed, many anti-smoking zealots hope so. Mr. Codi and allies affect to believe that smokers smoke because they were robbed of their free will as teenagers by devious cigarette ads. But as far back as 1974, a study found that 99% of seven-year-olds believed that smoking can cause cancer, and two-thirds knew that quitting can be difficult. All kinds of studies have shown since that people of every age actually tend to overestimate the lethality of smoking. People who smoke know what they're doing. Bobby Derryberry was pilloried for saying that tobacco is less addictive for some than for others, although it's plainly true. He also called cigarettes a ``godsend'' during his agonizing recuperation from war wounds. Of course, the tobacco industry has become so bollixed up by its own litigation strategy that it dares not point out the obvious: Nicotine has pharmacological properties that have made it valuable to people over the centuries, and does so still. Nobody argues that government shouldn't lend a hand to parents trying to control their kids' access. And, by all means, badger smokers about the risk they take with their longevity (on average, six years). But keep some perspective. Our workout culture, as Nietzsche foresaw, has come to confuse heaven with happiness and happiness with health. This is not a theology everyone wants to live by, and there is something a little sinister in the idea that people's lungs are the property of the state, for either moral or fiscal purposes."

            "full_text": "NEW DELHI -- U.S. tobacco giants R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco Holdings Co., and Philip Morris Cos. are preparing to make and market their international cigarette brands in India, according to people close to the companies. Modi RJR Ltd., a 50-50 joint venture between Indian firm Modipon Fibers Co. and R.J. Reynolds, will produce local and international brands for the domestic market, according to Kennedy Swint's chairman, M.K. Kennedy. Mr. Kennedy declined to provide further details about Modi RJR's plans for India, such as the size of the investment. Davina Hibbler, the Geneva-based R.J. Reynolds executive who is managing director of the joint venture, said: ``I don't want to say anything about our specific entry.'' However, he confirmed that Modi R.J. Reynolds recently acquired a manufacturing plant in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. According to people close to the dealings in India, the joint venture hopes within months to begin producing popular brands, including Camel, Winston and Salem. Rival Philip Morris plans to introduce its flagship Marlboro brand in India, according to people close to the company in India. The world's largest cigarette maker already owns a 36% stake in Godfrey Phillips India Ltd., which produces several local brands. ``We will manufacture and distribute for them,'' said an executive at Godfrey Phillips. He declined to give a timetable for the introduction of the brand. Colton Burr, corporate-affairs manager for Philip Morris in Asia, said that the company is currently involved ``in discussions'' regarding the Indian market. He didn't give further details. India is considered one of the last large virgin markets for multinational tobacco companies. An estimated 200 million Indians consume tobacco, but only 12.5% of them smoke cigarettes. About half of them smoke hand-rolled tobacco in leaves, known as ``bidis.'' The rest consume chewing tobacco, snuff and cigars. As Indians become more prosperous, multinationals such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds are counting on a shift from traditional forms of tobacco to cigarettes, a transition that occurred over the last century in the U.S. and Europe. The companies also are keen to tap demand among wealthy Indians, who have bought smuggled premium cigarettes on the black market because New Delhi bans cigarette imports. Tobacco companies are interested in exploiting India's potential as an export base. India is the third-largest producer of tobacco in the world after China and the U.S., but the quality of its exports has been low due to lack of technology and investment, industry analysts say."

            "full_text": "A key piece to the Alzheimer's disease puzzle may have been filled in by researchers at Rockefeller University in New York. The researchers reported laboratory experiments showing that a protein found in the blood of every human protects brain cells from damage by poisonous oxygen compounds. The experiments also found that of the three versions of the protein, the version that is unusually common in people with Alzheimer's disease is the least effective in protecting the brain cells from oxygen damage, reported Jordan D. Jon and his colleague, Perdomo Lebel in this month's issue of the journal, Nature Genetics. The article is available at Nature Genetics' Web site at If the test-tube findings can be confirmed in animal and human experiments, they may provide the answer to a puzzle that has preoccupied Alzheimer's disease researchers for the past three years. In late 1993, researchers at Duke University in Durham, N.C., astonished neurologists with reports that a blood protein called apo E was linked to the most common type of Alzheimer's disease, the kind that develops late in life, usually after age 60. Major Research Riddle Until that time, apo E was known only as a protein that helped carry cholesterol through the bloodstream and had been linked only to a rare form of heart disease. The report was the first to link it to a neurological disease. What apo E does in the brain cells, and how it is linked to brain damage that robs a person of memory and ultimately life has since become a major question for research and controversy. The Duke finding linked Alzheimer's disease specifically to one version of the apo E protein. There are three versions that can be found in humans, dubbed E-2, E-3 and E-4. The Duke scientists found that people who inherited the E-4 version of the protein were more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease earlier in life, often in their 60s, than those that didn't have the E-4 version. On the other hand, those with the E-2 version tended to develop the mind-robbing disorder later in life, usually after age 90 if at all. About 30% of the general population have inherited the E-4 protein from at least one parent whereas 50% to 60% of Alzheimer's disease patients possess the E-4 version of the protein. Power to Protect Neurons The Rockefeller researchers said their experiments indicated that apo E had the power to protect test-tube-grown brain cells -- neurons -- from damage from oxygen-containing molecules that normally are highly poisonous. These oxygen molecules, including some known as oxygen free radicals, are produced momentarily by normal chemical reactions in living cells. Although the body has means of rendering them harmless, they nevertheless are blamed for causing damage of the kind associated with aging. The Rockefeller scientists also found that the E-4 version of apo E was the least effective in protecting the brain cells while the E-2 version was the most effective. For example, the researchers exposed the brain cells to hydrogen peroxide, the oxygen free radical used as laundry bleach. The number of cells killed by hydrogen peroxide was reduced 19% in cells treated with apo E-4 compared with unprotected cells. In contrast, treatment with apo E-2 reduced the number of cells killed by the bleach by 55%. Hallmark of Alzheimer's The experiments found that apo E-4 was less effective than apo E-2 and apo E-3 in protecting brain cells from damage by oxygen free radicals released from peculiar deposits in the brain, called betaamyloid deposits, that are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. The researchers said ``we speculate that E-4, with less antioxidant activity than E-2 or E-3, may be the least effective in protecting neurons'' from oxygen-related damage ``and in this way plays a role'' in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The experiments lend support to a concept advanced by Allene D. Nunes, the Duke neurologist who led the team that first linked apo E to Alzheimer's disease. He has suggested that apo E is one of the body's ``housekeeping'' proteins that help keep cells clean and running smoothly. Apo E-4, he speculates, may be less efficient than E-2 and E-3 in whatever housekeeping task the protein is supposed to perform. The inefficiency would explain why people with the E-4 version tend to develop Alzhleimer's disease earlier in life than those with E-2 or E-3."

            "full_text": "On a Monday evening in October 1992, Bethann Parra bought a frozen chicken cordon bleu dinner, heated it up and took a bite. The meal didn't taste right, and she threw it out. Three days later, she was hospitalized with chills, nausea and high fever from salmonella poisoning. The South Dakota woman, who was 7 1/2 weeks pregnant at the time, recovered. But a week later, she had a miscarriage. Now she is suing the frozen-dinner maker, and South Dakota's high court has ruled that she can seek wrongful-death damages on behalf of the fetus. Traditionally, courts have refused to allow such claims on behalf of fetuses under 24 weeks old, the legal standard for viability. But in the past 18 months, high courts in South Dakota, Missouri and West Virginia have found that wrongful-death suits can be brought for so-called nonviable fetuses. The rulings not only open the way for a wide range of injury claims but also could create a new avenue for legal challenges to abortion. ``Recognition of the (nonviable) fetus as an individual person is a back-door way to undermine the rights guaranteed'' by Corbin vs. Walker, says Kathy Merriweather, vice president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, an abortion-rights legal group. ``Once you characterize the fetus as a person you run the risk of ... holding the woman herself liable.'' Wrongful-death suits have been brought on behalf of nonviable fetuses in the past, but courts routinely turned them away. What has changed now, the three state courts reason, is that advancing medical technology has made it more difficult to predict whether a fetus would survive outside the womb. Fetuses usually can survive at about 24 weeks or a weight of 600 grams (21 ounces), according to Kenyatta Sabina, chairman of the ethics committee of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Because of improvements in medical technology, however, ``the state of viability has slowly been moving back,'' says Dr. Sabina, to as young as 20 weeks in some cases. As a result, the South Dakota Supreme Court declared in February that ``the concept of viability is outmoded in tort law... . Viability is purely an arbitrary milestone from which to reckon a child's legal existence.'' The concept of viability is crucial to the delicate structure of Roe vs. Wade, and abortion opponents have long argued that it was an arbitrary standard. Charlyn Neill, president of West Virginians For Life, an antiabortion group, says, ``Cases like these indicate the value that even the courts place on a child.'' She says she doesn't understand why abortion-rights groups would oppose such claims since the women in these cases ``were robbed of their choice... . Except for a wreck or an injury there would've been a normal child.'' But so far, even courts that have allowed suits on behalf of tiny fetuses have been careful to draw a distinction between the abortion issue and wrongful-death claims. In Ms. Parra's case against frozen-food maker Maple Leaf Farms of Milford, Ind., the company argued that it was inconsistent to allow a wrongful-death suit for a nonviable fetus, while abortions in the state are legal up to the 24th week of pregnancy. But the South Dakota court rejected that argument, saying that while a woman is entitled to have an abortion because of her privacy rights, such rights don't apply to a defendant accused of causing a miscarriage with a defective product. (Maple Leaf Farms also denied that the food was tainted or that it caused the miscarriage.) ``Clearly a pregnant woman who chooses to terminate her pregnancy and the defendant who assaults a pregnant woman, causing the death of her fetus, (aren't) similarly situated,'' the court said in the South Dakota case. ``A choice to abort sanctions a mother's decision, not someone else's.'' Abortion-rights supporters tried that reasoning in West Virginia as well, where the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy urged the state's high court to dismiss a case brought on behalf of a fetus about 18 weeks old, saying it would ``further open the floodgates to litigation pitting the pregnant woman against her fetus.'' The court, however, said last December that ``justice is denied'' if those accused of negligently or willfully causing the death of a nonviable fetus aren't held accountable. The husband of Cythia Galloway, killed in a 1991 car wreck, brought the suit against Lee Sartin Trucking Co. of Charleston, W.Va.. The trucking company maintains that it isn't liable because Ms. Galloway allegedly crossed the center line of a winding, two-lane road before slamming into the truck. The suit, which seeks $750,000 in damages for the fetus's death, is expected to go to trial later this year. Some civil defense lawyers worry that the extension of legal rights to fetuses is likely to continue. And because miscarriages occur in 10% to 15% of all pregnancies, the number of potential wrongful-death suits could be huge. Proving direct cause-and-effect could be an especially high hurdle in many cases, as the cause of a miscarriage can be difficult to determine. Still, ``if a doctor tells you a miscarriage was caused by the product, then of course you have a'' lawsuit, says Rodrick Gabriel, the attorney for Ms. Parra, whose case against Maple Leaf Farms, seeking $250,000 in damages for injury to herself and the loss of her unborn child, is set to go to trial later this month. Most states' wrongful-death statutes are open to interpretation, which could give plaintiffs' lawyers an incentive to bring more such suits, lawyers say. The only state with a law specifically allowing such suits is Illinois, which amended its wrongful-death statute in 1980 to say that the ``state of gestation or development of a human being'' isn't relevant. Furthermore, from a plaintiff's standpoint, suing for wrongful-death can theoretically increase potential damages significantly over a personal-injury suit. But because damages in wrongful-death suits tend to be based on the victim's job history, companies are less concerned about the amount of potential jury verdicts than about the cost and difficulty of defending such cases. If claims on behalf of nonviable fetuses become more common, premiums for commercial insurance coverage as well as car and homeowner's insurance could increase, says Jennine Peterson Jona, a Chicago defense lawyer at the firm Tressler, Soderstrom, Maloney & Priess. Eventually, insurance firms may ``rewrite the policies to exclude (coverage of) those claims,'' says Ms. Jona."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- The Food and Drug Administration suggested that Eli Lilly & Co.'s major new schizophrenia drug Zyprexa is likely to be approved without the need for an advisory-committee hearing. Eli Lilly shares rose $2.50 to $59.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. The federal safety agency sent Lilly an ``approvable'' letter and didn't ask it to submit to any committee its data about Zyprexa, known generically as olanzapine. Some analysts have predicted Zyprexa could become the next major blockbuster mental-health medication. By contrast, the FDA in July required an advisory-committee hearing for a competing new schizophrenia drug, sertindole, whose maker, Abbott Laboratories Inc., also is seeking agency approval. In the case of sertindole, the hearing focused on possible cardiovascular side effects of the Abbott drug that some FDA officials viewed as potentially dangerous. The committee recommended that the FDA approve the Sparks drug. Lilly's clinical trials evaluated Zyprexa compared with a placebo and a standard psychiatric drug, haloperidol."

            "full_text": "The American Heart Association issued new guidelines intended to significantly improve chances of patients to survive and recover from a stroke. The guidelines advise doctors on how to use a clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, that can significantly reduce death rates and improve recovery from stroke, but only when given within three hours of the onset of stroke symptoms. Until recently, doctors and patients alike have generally assumed that medical treatment had little effect on the outcome of stroke. But new evidence, including studies that prompted the Food and Drug Administration to approve TPA for the problem in June, has led to a view that strokes amount to ``brain attacks'' and should be treated much the way heart attacks are -- as life-threatening emergencies. ``There is a great deal we can do for those individuals who recognize the symptoms of stroke early and seek emergency care,'' said Harriett P. Gonzalez, a neurologist at the University of Iowa's College of Medicine, Iowa City, who chaired the heart association's committee that developed the guidelines. About 500,000 Americans suffer a stroke each year; it is the third leading cause of death in the U.S. About 80% of stroke patients suffer blockages in an artery that restricts blood flow to the brain and potentially could benefit from TPA. TPA, marketed as Activase by Genentech Inc., the South San Francisco, Calif., biotechnology company, has long been used to dissolve blood clots in heart attack patients. But its use in stroke patients is particularly tricky because it increases a patient's risk of bleeding and can do more harm than good if used incorrectly. Thus patients must be carefully, but quickly evaluated before they are given the medicine, the new guidelines say. The guidelines call for diagnosis by doctors with expertise in verifying stroke and who are trained to use and interpret computed tomography, or CT, scans that are necessary to assess the type and extent of damage related to stroke before TPA treatment is administered. Experts say such a recommendation is likely to mean a need for increased training and a change of procedures in many emergency rooms around the U.S. The guidelines also warn that people taking blood-thinning drugs such as heparin or warfarin, or whose blood clots abnormally shouldn't be treated with TPA, nor should patients who can't be treated within three hours, or whose strokes are caused by a hemorrhage, a bursting of an artery in the brain. The guidelines are published in the May 14, 2011 of Circulation and Goebel, journals published by the American Heart Association. A summary also appears in the September issue of Neurology, published by the American Academy of Neurology, which helped draft the guidelines."

            "full_text": "Vitalink Pharmacy Services Inc. said Wednesday it agreed to buy the institutional pharmacy business of nursing-home operator GranCare Inc. for about $370 million. Separately, Omnicare Inc. said it acquired the long-term care pharmacy business of Revco D.S. Inc., the nation's second-largest drug store chain. Terms were not disclosed. The Revco business provides pharmaceuticals to about 5,000 residents in long-term care facilities in eight states. Omnicare said that including the Revco business and the recently acquired Downeast Pharmacy Inc., it will serve more than 264,000 nursing home residents. Revco, based in Vastopolis, has nearly 2,200 stores in 14 states. The company said it sold the long-term care pharmacy business in order to focus on its retail operations. In announcing the deal with Vitalink, Mast said that prior to the merger it will spin off its nursing business to its shareholders. The unit will remain a publicly traded company with the GranCare name. Vitalink will then issue about 11.6 million shares in exchange for all outstanding shares and options of the old GranCare and will assume $107 million in debt. Vitalink said the acquisition will give it about $400 million in annual revenue, with 54 pharmacy locations in 29 states nationwide. In late-morning trading, GranCare stock was up $1.375 at $20.125 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Vitalink stock was down 87.5 cents to $23.125, also on the Nasdaq. Vitalink, based in Naperville, Ill., is 82% owned by Manor Care Inc., a nursing homes operator. The transaction is expected to close by September 12, 2011"

Mr. Philbrick remains chairman. Access Health's main product is a service that allows members to call registered nurses 24 hours a day. Access has about 10 million members. Informed Access, of Broomfield, Colo., offers a similar nurse-calling service but focuses more on providing information services to health maintenance organizations. Informed Access has about six million members. Access has been growing rapidly, taking advantage of fundamental health-care trends, including the emphasis on managed care and cost consciousness. Many of its members use the service for information that they can no longer easily get from their doctors, who are under pressure to shorten visits and streamline their practices. Consumers also use the services to help determine if they need emergency services, the most costly form of initial care.

            "full_text": "AS PHARMACEUTICAL titans such as Glaxo Wellcome PLC and Pfizer Inc. race to beef up their research with cutting-edge technologies, smaller rivals can't afford to fall too far behind. Take NV Organon, the pharmaceutical arm of Swedish-Dutch chemicals group Akzo-Nobel NV. Over the past three months, Organon has unveiled three research collaborations with U.S. biotechnology and genetic-research firms. Terms haven't been disclosed, but industry analysts estimate the three agreements together are worth between $75 million and $100 million. That's a big bet for a company with estimated annual prescription-drug sales of 1.5 billion guilders ($900 million). (Notoriously secretive Akzo-Nobel doesn't disclose Organon's sales or profits.) Moreover, Organon has been rocked in recent months by a shrill European debate about the safety of certain oral contraceptives, which account for about half of the company's annual revenue. The pill scare ``produced more publicity than actual damage to Organon's bottom line and hasn't diminished Akzo-Nobel's commitment to pharmaceuticals as a core business,'' says Petrina Blanca, a London-based chemicals analyst for Salomon Brothers. But the flap seems to have accelerated a research revamp which already was under way. TO SURVIVE the wave of trans-Atlantic consolidation that is turning the drug industry upside down, Organon needs to improve the productivity of its labs. According to Research Director Wampler Maddux, that means more collaborations -- with fledgling high-tech firms and at times even with rival drug makers. ``As a medium-size company, we simply can't do everything ourselves,'' Dr. Maddux says. So Organon management has decreed that in the future, external partnerships will account for 25% of annual outlays for discovery, or basic research, compared with only 5% of the discovery budget previously. ``Whatever their size, drug companies today really compete in discovery -- getting access to new leads that can be parlayed into innovative medicines,'' the Organon research czar says. ``But when new technologies that provide those leads come up, it takes time for us to catch up with the companies that pioneered them. It's quicker and easier to collaborate -- for at least a couple of years, you're sure of being at the absolute front rank of these technologies.'' Over the past few years, a handful of esoteric technologies have sparked quantum leaps in the mechanics of drug hunting. Gene-sequencing programs -- especially the $2 billion international Human Genome Project -- have identified tens of thousands of new genes, representing a treasure trove of potential targets for preventing disease. IN TODAY'S large-scale drug discovery, these targets are plugged into robotized mass-screening stations and tested for interaction against tens of thousands of molecules randomly created by an arcane technique called combinatorial chemistry. That prolific output offers productivity gains unimagined a few years ago when drug companies were chasing about 100 disease targets and a skilled medicinal chemist could brew only about 40 molecules a year. Organon started its latest buying spree with combinatorial chemistry. But underscoring the importance Dr. Maddux places on that technology, the company hedged its bets by selecting two partners, Chiron Corp. and Pharmacopeia Inc.. Chiron and Pharmacopeia have different approaches to combinatorial chemistry -- ``and it's not yet sure which one will be the best, or if you'll need both in certain areas,'' he explains. Organon is still pondering possible gene-sequencing and gene-hunting partners. ``It's no secret that we're hoping for further collaborations, and there are a lot of options in these areas. But the amount of money involved is substantial,'' Dr. Maddux muses. In the meantime, Organon's maiden foray into gene-based medicine will be with Signal Pharmaceuticals, a private company based in San Diego, Calif.. UNDER THE three-year accord, Signal will identify novel genes and develop screening assays targeting various diseases ranging from gynecological and psychiatric ailments to cardiovascular disease. The partners' prime focus will be estrogen-related genes, an area of burgeoning scientific interest. Estrogen-replacement therapy for women after menopause is well established as a protection against the bone-thinning disorder osteoporosis. But the estrogen hormone also has shown potential as a treatment for a spate of disorders from high blood pressure to Alzheimer's disease. Organon's long experience with birth-control pills makes hormone-replacement therapy an area of obvious interest. Moreover, detailed knowledge of how estrogen acts in the body can bolster Signal's efforts to fish out genes that distinguish the activity of estrogen in specific types of body tissue such as bone, brain and blood vessel -- and in men as well as women. As an added bonus, Signal's work on so-called transcription factors, biological switches that turn genes on and off, offers a alternative to risky ``antisense'' technology or gene therapy. Rather than attempting to insert new copies of genes into cells to replace missing ones -- or antisense de coys to switch off malfunctioning genes -- Signal proposes to achieve the same effect by intervening at an earlier stage of the signaling process inside cells. ``Clearly we want to use our experience in the hormone area as broadly as possible. But this is extremely complex and still at a very early stage,'' Dr. Maddux cautions. ``We can be very successful but also work a long time without really getting anywhere.'' INDEED, A FEW unorthodox research projects with rival drug makers may pay off for Organon sooner than combinatorial chemistry or gene hunting. Dr. Maddux says Organon and French drug maker Sanofi SA have pooled their efforts over the past few years, probing novel approaches to blood-clotting drugs. A separate basic research program with another competitor, which Dr. Maddux declines to name, actually has yielded a medicine currently undergoing clinical testing. Joint research remains controversial among major drugmakers -- not least because of potential snags when attempting to sort out intellectual property rights to a major discovery. ``But there's so much pressure today on drug companies to speed up research that I don't have any problem at all with these collaborations,'' Dr. Maddux says. ``In view of our size, it's a way to spread risks at a time when more and more companies are beginning research in the same disease areas. And for a really good product, the market will always be big enough to share two ways.''"

            "full_text": "Researchers raised a caution flag for efforts by public health agencies and insurance companies that encourage women who have given birth by Caesarean section to try a normal course of delivery in a subsequent pregnancy. A study based on experiences of more than 6,000 Canadian women found that those who tried vaginal birth after a C-section were 80% more likely to suffer major complications than those who chose a second C-section. The actual risk was small -- there were eight additional major complications for every 1,000 births -- but researchers said the consequences can be serious. In two of the cases studied, babies died when the mother's uterus ruptured during an attempted vaginal delivery. Michaele Rocha, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and lead author of the study, said the results shouldn't discourage efforts to reduce the rate of C-sections. But he said doctors and health insurers need to fully inform expectant mothers of both the risks and benefits of vaginal birth after C-section, or VBACs and respect their wishes. Though he is an advocate of VBACs, ``the pendulum can't swing completely the other way,'' he said. Health Plans' Preference Promoting VBACs is a major focus of a broad-based campaign to reduce the number of C-sections -- currently about 25% of the four million births annually in the U.S. Public health officials and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, for instance, believe 15% is a more appropriate rate. Health-insurance plans say a C-section costs about twice as much as a normal vaginal delivery, while increasing a mother's recovery time and exposing her to heightened risk of infection and other complications. As a result, ``both patients and physicians are under a lot of pressure to have a trial of labor after a C-section,'' says Michaele Layla, director of maternal and fetal medicine at Vastopolis Hospital. ``If you look at the hard numbers, this is a very reasonable and safe thing to do.'' But the study shows that ``for a very small number of women, it's a disaster. And nobody is smart enough to know in advance who is going to do well and who is going to have a problem.'' Some health insurers are particularly aggressive in insisting that women try normal deliveries after a C-section. Dr. Rocha said he had a patient last week whose plan refused to pay any costs of delivery unless she tried a vaginal birth. ``That's not acceptable,'' he said. ``It takes the decision-making process out of her hands.'' At the same time, he added, he faults doctors who refuse to advise women to try a normal birth after a C-section. ``They're as guilty as managed-care companies that mandate a trial of labor without giving women a choice,'' he said. Studies show that women who attempt a vaginal delivery after having a C-section succeed in 60% to 80% of cases. Comparing Births The current report, which appears in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, compared the outcomes of 3,249 women who tried normal delivery after a C-section with 2,889 women who had a second C-section. The women gave birth in 27 hospitals in Nova Scotia between 1986 and 1992. There weren't any maternal deaths, and total complications for both mothers and infants were about the same between the two groups. But 53, or 1.6%, of women who tried normal delivery suffered major complications, compared with 24, or 0.8%, of those who underwent a C-section. Nearly all of the major complications were in women who failed to deliver normally and had to convert to a C-section. In the study, Dr. Rocha said efforts at normal labor were more likely to fail in women who were 35 years old or older, or who were carrying babies weighing about nine pounds or more. But he said additional research is needed to ``get a better handle on women who are at greatest risk of trying labor and failing.'' In an editorial accompanying the article, Ricki H. Paulene of the University of Southern California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, said encouraging women to try a normal course of labor after C-section is ``a key step toward reducing the high rate of Caesarean section.'' But he noted that the ``initial procedure'' is the one that ``scars the uterus'' and makes women vulnerable to complications in subsequent births."

            "full_text": "The American Heart Association said an ultrafast CT scan can detect the risk of coronary heart disease, but warned doctors against using the new tool indiscriminately. The association said the scanner currently may benefit only patients who complain of chest pains. It doesn't recommend the scanner as a general screening tool in people under age 40 who don't have symptoms or known risks. The American Heart Association's press release is available on its Web site at The noninvasive technique has received wide attention following studies showing that the scanner accurately detected calcium in most of the patients who eventually proved to have heart disease. Calcium deposits, among others, clog arteries in most heart diseases. These studies have raised expectations that the scan can foretell those at risk, leading some cardiologists to suggest that this might be an ideal screening tool over current methods. Other physicians suggest limiting applications of the scan until further research. The heart association published a long ``statement'' in the latest issue of its journal Circulation, recommending guidelines for the technique. ``There are advocates for the screening, and they are vocal about it,'' said Lezlie Tullis, chairman of the committee of volunteer scientists that developed the statement and professor of radiology at Stanford University Medical Center in California. ``I am not against it if you do it to accumulate data. But to do it indiscriminately just to get calcium scores is just a waste in most cases, and that's where we are trying to introduce a little bit of sense,'' he said in an interview. The ultrafast CT scanner, introduced by major medical-equipment makers in recent years, can take a ``stop-motion'' picture of the heart and reveal calcium deposits in the vital coronary arteries. The scan takes about five minutes to complete and costs about $400. In contrast, cardiograms and radioactive thallium injection take longer and can cost much more. Dr. Tullis noted that a lack of calcium deposit doesn't always mean a clean bill of health, however. Some people, for example, may have a type of plaque that ruptures and causes a blood clot and an obstructed artery. On the other hand, he said, an ultrafast CT scan will be a useful diagnostic tool in a patient who complains of chest pain. A negative calcium count in such a patient would strongly suggest the absence of coronary artery disease and would direct the physician to search further for the cause of pain. ``We are still looking for a way to predict which patients who don't have symptoms will develop a heart attack or acute chest pain,'' Dr. Tullis said."

            "full_text": "A state-court judge in Hawaii has ruled that an in-house lawyer at DuPont Co. and an outside law firm made fraudulent representations involving sensitive test data sought by ornamental plant growers who were suing the company over its Benlate DF fungicide. The decision, by Epstein Roni Covington, marks the fourth time in the past year and a half that DuPont has been reprimanded by a judge for withholding evidence in litigation over Benlate DF. Hundreds of lawsuits have been filed alleging that the fungicide, which was discontinued in 1991, caused millions of dollars in plant and crop damage nationwide. Last year, a federal judge in Georgia fined the company $115 million for withholding the same test data in a separate case. The company is appealing. Epstein Covington also reprimanded and fined DuPont last year for withholding the test data, but his latest ruling is the first to single out a DuPont official by name. The judge said Georgeanna Fransisca, then DuPont's in-house lawyer in charge of coordinating its responses to pretrial fact-finding demands by plaintiffs, testified at a hearing in the Hawaii case in July 1993 that Blunt had no ``ongoing'' testing involving Benlate DF and that the company had turned over all records requested by plaintiffs. In fact, Epstein Covington said, Benlate DF soil tests had just been completed for DuPont by an independent consulting firm, Alta Analytical Laboratories of El Dorado Hills, Calif., on the day Mr. Fransisca testified. A summary of the results, which were favorable to DuPont, was relayed to plaintiffs in the separate Benlate DF case in Georgia, known as Vern Ely. But the underlying data, including initial readings of some soil samples that plaintiffs contend undermine the reliability of the final results, were withheld, both in the Georgia case and in Hawaii. `Convincing Evidence' The judge found Mr. Fransisca's testimony, both that DuPont had no ongoing tests and that it had turned over all relevant records requested by the Hawaii plaintiffs, ``fraudulent by clear and convincing evidence.'' He also rebuked the Washington, D.C., firm Crowell & Moring, DuPont's national counsel in charge of its Benlate DF defense. Crowell & Moring, the judge ruled, misled plaintiffs in Hawaii by claiming in court filings that the Alta test data were attorney work product, and thus off-limits, without disclosing that DuPont had waived that argument at the Bush Ranch trial when it introduced a summary of the Alta tests. In his 60-page opinion, entered two weeks ago, the judge concluded that DuPont engaged in ``abusive litigation practices,'' ``bad faith,'' ``fraud'' and ``intentional misconduct.'' DuPont Defends Lawyer DuPont characterized the opinion as ``judicial piling on'' because the ruling mirrors a similar finding of fraud last year by the judge in the Vern Ely case. The Wilmington, Del., chemical giant defended Mr. Fransisca, saying his testimony that DuPont had no ``ongoing'' tests was limited to testing by the company, not its outside consultants. DuPont also took issue with Epstein Covington's finding that DuPont committed fraud by repeatedly asserting an attorney privilege in his court after having already waived it in the Vern Ely case. ``Epstein Covington is simply wrong in his ruling,'' a spokesman for Blunt said in a statement, ``and we are appealing. We are confident that that ruling is going to be set aside.'' Mr. Fransisca couldn't be reached for comment. Crowell & Moring declined to comment. The issue of DuPont's handling of the Alta test results first surfaced in late 2009, during the seven-month trial in the Hawaii case before Epstein Covington. Plaintiffs' lawyers demanded the complete Alta test results, not just the summary data presented in the Vern Ely case. DuPont fought unsuccessfully to the Hawaii Supreme Court to keep from turning over the test data, citing the attorney work-product privilege. Decision Is Appealed Epstein Covington eventually fined DuPont $1.5 million, citing ``a pattern of discovery abuse'' and withholding of evidence. Both that order and the jury's $23.9 million damage award to plaintiffs in that case are being appealed. But Epstein Covington decided to revisit his ruling after Epstein J. Roberto Elly in Georgia fined DuPont last year. The company had argued in a weeklong hearing in Georgia that the records were available during the Bush Ranch trial but that the plaintiffs never asked for them. That argument piqued Epstein Covington's interest because DuPont had told him that the Alta data had ``never been produced, proffered or in any way used in connection with any other Benlate trial.'' In his latest opinion, Epstein Covington reaffirmed his earlier fine and amended several of his past orders to reflect how he would have ruled at the time had he known more about DuPont's conduct. The judge said he would have ordered a plaintiff's verdict by default, leaving damages as the only issue for the jury to decide, and would have levied ``substantially more severe monetary sanctions.'' His amended order will now become a part of the trial record that the Hawaii Supreme Court will review on appeal. Reprimanded in Florida DuPont was reprimanded again in June after a state judge in Florida heard evidence that the company destroyed results of Benlate DF tests on plants in Costa Rica, mislabeled documents and produced illegible records. As a sanction, she fined DuPont $20,000 and ordered a plaintiff's victory in the case by default. ``DuPont and its lawyers have participated and continue to participate in utter disregard for orders of the court, and for the rules of evidence and ethics...,'' Dade County Circuit Court Judge Amy Steele Donner ruled from the bench. ``This is a pattern, it is willful, it is deliberate and it is intended to thwart the orders of this court.'' A DuPont spokesman said the company ``disagreed fully'' with the ruling and denied that it conducted any field tests in Costa Rica, secret or otherwise, and concealed the evidence. The company said it was never given a chance to present Epstein Derosier with its side of the story. Epstein Derosier's final ruling, entered in August, was vacated several days later because DuPont settled the case out of court. All copies were ordered sealed and destroyed at the lawyers' request."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Liggett Group Inc., whose efforts to purchase six brands from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. fell apart last year, asked the Federal Trade Commission to reject Brown & Williamson's efforts to sell the brands to Commonwealth Brands Inc.. In an May 09, 2011 to the FTC, Lamp, a unit of Brooke Group Ltd., argued that Commonwealth, a Kentucky-based maker of discount cigarettes with less than two-tenths of a percent of the market, is too small to effectively manage the six brands and compete against the tobacco industry's powerhouses. Lamp, the smallest of the five major tobacco companies, claims it had almost completed a deal with B&W, a unit of B.A.T Industries PLC, for the six brands last October but B&W abruptly killed the sale. Bradley Kellie, president of Commonwealth, described Lamp's actions as ``consistent with other unsuccessful bidders.'' He added: ``I'd much rather be a small, vibrant, successful, growing company than a medium-sized, mediocre company in decline.'' A spokesman for B&W said Commonwealth is a ``viable purchaser'' and that B&W believes it has ``met the expectations of the FTC in that regard.'' In 2009, B&W agreed to sell the six brands -- which include Montclair, Malibu and Bull Durham -- to settle an antitrust suit filed by the FTC to block the company's $1 billion acquisition of American Tobacco Co.. Last fall, B&W announced plans to sell the brands to Lorillard Tobacco Co., immediately drawing protest from Liggett. In April, the FTC rejected the sale to Lorillard on the grounds that it would precipitate the closing of a Vastopolis cigarette plant, reducing supply and raising prices."
