            "full_text": "The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 172.15 to 10627.98. ``For the time being we're at the mercy of the Dow Jones,'' said K.K. Belt, a dealer at Dao Heng Securities Ltd.. But he noted that buying on the bourse of select shares helped support the key index at 10600 points. Meanwhile, the broader All Ordinaries Index lost 61.31 to 5165.64. Volume for the session jumped to 6.25 billion Hong Kong dollars in value, the highest in four months, from the preceding session's HK$3.34 billion. Traders said the market's decline was concentrated on the heavily weighted banking and property concerns. But buying continued in China-related stocks, due to market talk that the mainland is looking at cutting its interest rates. Among the key subindexes, the financials dropped 1.5%. The day's most active stock, banking giant HSBC Holdings, slipped HK$2 to HK$118.50. HSBC subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd. slipped HK$1 to HK$75.50 while Bank of East Asia Ltd. dipped 35 Hong Kong cents to HK$27.15. The property subindex slumped 1.9%. Developer Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. surrendered HK$1 to HK$52.75 while Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. plunged HK$2 to HK$72.25. The utilities shed 1.5%. HongKong Telecommunications Ltd. slid 20 cents to HK$12.95, while China Light & Power dropped 50 cents to HK$33.50. And the commercial and industrial subindex fell 1.4%. Conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. fell 70 cents to HK$46.40. The stock exchange said earlier Tuesday that local billionaire Liana Ka-Korey, who owns Hutchison and Wynne Hudgens, had lifted his stake in the companies by 0.3% and by 0.1%, respectively, on March 20, 2011 the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the Chinese Class H shares, rebounded 8.33 to 800.72. Shanghai Petrochemical, one of the larger H shares, jumped 8.5 cents to HK$2.075, while the listed arm of the Guangzhou provincial government, Guangzhou Investment, surged 5 cents to HK$2.20 in heavy trading. The company said it plans to join a host of other companies in spinning off their China infrastructure projects. Elsewhere, shares of Wheelock ended at HK$14.65, down 30 cents. The conglomerate reported that its net income for the year ended December 11, 2010 6.6% to HK$2.46 billion, in line with forecasts."

It was the index's lowest close since July 15, 2010 and steepest one-day correction since November 21, 2010 The price slide follows a selloff in the U.S. equities market Monday, where concerns about future corporate earnings triggered a 2.9% retracement in the Dow Jones Industrial Index. Nestor Bryce, of Morgan Stockbroking Ltd., said Australian stocks were weaker ``across the board in sympathy with Wall Street. The market assumed its level very early this morning and has pretty much stayed there all day,'' he said. While all market sectors ended lower, gold-mining stocks were particularly hard hit. Despite a strengthening bullion price, the gold shares subindex fell 3.3%. As the share market closed, bullion was trading in Sydney around US$384.70 an ounce, up from U.S.$383.90 late Monday. Mr. Bryce said that while some shareholders were ``spooked'' by the market's recent volatility, others were attracted back into the market by the lower prices. The day's high volume suggested institutions were among the bargain hunters, he said."

            "full_text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index fell 34.73 to 4920.59, after falling 86.12 on Monday. Declining issues outpaced advancers, 669 to 244. Total volume was 82.1 million shares valued at $1.39 billion Canadian, up from Monday's 60.3 million shares valued at C$892.4 million. But Toronto looked almost tranquil compared with the wild swings in New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 9.25 at 5358.76, after gyrating between a low of 5182.32 and a high of 5402.04. In Toronto, thin trading due a lack of available buyers helped to make sure the recovery in the TSE's benchmark fell well short of the Dow, traders said. With a lot of fund managers sitting on the sidelines in anticipation of a further correction in the market, sellers had to settle for sharper declines in prices than would otherwise be the case, said Gregorio Cammack, research director at Griffiths McBurney & Partners. Mr. Cammack also said the lack of buyers indicated that fund managers will return to the market in the near term, as the correction shows signs of weakening. Indeed, Tuesday's partial retracement in the TSE's key benchmark lends support to this view. Overall, 12 of the TSE's 14 subgroups fell, with the gold group leading the way, down 2.68%. In the group, Barrick Gold fell 1 to 36. The steep decline among gold stocks isn't that surprising, since the June Consumer Price Index in the U.S. came in slightly below expectations Tuesday morning, quelling fears of rising inflation. Gold stocks traditionally rise amid concerns over higher prices, because bullion is seen as a hedge against inflation."

            "full_text": "Lane Crawford International's stock has ``on sale'' written all over it, some investment bankers say. Unloved by analysts and investors, Lane Crawford's shares are trading at a sharp discount to their net asset value, or the value per share of the firm's assets minus its liabilities. The big NAV discount is attracting window-shoppers intrigued by speculation that the company is ripe for a friendly takeover offer, or that 72%-owner Wheelock could take the Hong Kong-listed retailer private. Lane Crawford's Class A shares had an NAV per share of 24.76 Hong Kong dollars (US$3.20) as of December 10, 2009 the latest figure available from the company. At Monday's closing price of HK$13.40, that means the shares are trading at a discount of 46% to NAV. (The company's less-widely followed Class B shares are trading at a similar discount to NAV.) The stock's prospective price/earnings ratio is slightly lower than some other Hong Kong retailers. The consensus earnings-per-share forecast for the year ending December 11, 2010 HK$1.35 per A share, according to the July edition of the Estimate Directory, which puts the shares at a prospective P/E multiple of around 10. ``What Lanelle Herlinda needs is for someone like Santana Glidewell to buy it and turn it around,'' says one Hong Kong-based investment banker. Mr. Glidewell's Hong Kong-listed Dickson Concepts (International) successfully revived flagging London department store Hayden Granville and floated the company on the London stock exchange earlier this year. Dickson Concepts executives couldn't be reached to comment on whether the company is interested in Lane Crawford. However, when Dickson Concepts announced its results last month it said it had cash of HK$1.2 billion following the flotation of Hayden Granville, adding that ``the group's strong cash position places it in an ideal position to take advantage of any suitable investment opportunities when they arise.'' Alternatively, there is now so much bad news in the stock price, Wheelock could buy the shares it doesn't already own and take Lanell Henry private relatively cheaply, with a view to refloating it later or selling off its assets piecemeal, some corporate financiers say. ``I don't think the share price will get much lower, so it would make sense for Wheelock to take it (Lane Crawford) private and just keep the portfolio,'' suggests one analyst who follows the stock. But, she adds, in order to take Lanell Henry private ``Wheelock would have to offer say a 5% to 10% premium to the market price.'' Gay Flowers, head of corporate affairs at Wheelock, says he can't comment on whether Wheelock is considering selling its stake in Lane Crawford. He says Wheelock isn't considering taking the retailing concern private. Aside from speculation about going private or a takeover, are there any compelling reasons for taking a punt on the stock? The prospect of a rebound in Hong Kong's retail sector has helped to boost the share prices of some badly battered retailing stocks in recent months. ``The recovery in real retail sales since the beginning of 2011 has been encouraging,'' Salomon Brothers says in a recent report on Hong Kong's consumer sector. ``We believe the positive developments are unlikely to be caused by seasonal factors alone, as the consumption recovery has been broadly based,'' Riles adds, pointing to signs of recovery in restaurant receipts and a bottoming out in car sales. While Salomon Brothers didn't include Lane Crawford in its report on the consumer sector, other analysts and investors say that Lanell Henry fails to make the grade as an attractive investment on several counts. In its home territory of Hong Kong, Lanelle Herlinda has acquired a poor image, some analysts say. ``When it comes to marketing and merchandising in Hong Kong, there's plenty of room for improvement,'' says one analyst. Milton Batts Hyon, managing partner at Value Partners, a fund-management firm in Hong Kong, says he looked at the possibility of investing in Lanell Henry several months ago but rejected the idea. ``We visited their stores, and they are old and tired, with no sex appeal,'' Mr. Milton says. Lanell Henry, which was once regarded as the Hong Kong equivalent of Harrods, has ``blown away its strong name,'' he adds. Outside Hong Kong, Lanelle Herlinda has also stumbled. The company set up shop in Singapore with great fanfare in 2009, and then drastically reduced the size of its store there in 2010. ``They expanded at the wrong time and in the wrong place,'' says one analyst. While other upmarket retailers have managed to weather the difficult conditions in Hong Kong, Lanell Henry's profit plunged 88% to HK$16.4 million in the year ended December 11, 2010 Mr. Flowers says Wheelock isn't satisfied with that performance but ``we aim to improve and it takes some time for the performance to turn around.'' The poor performance in fiscal 2011 can be blamed largely on the general retailing climate, Mr. Flowers says, rather than bad management. Others aren't so convinced. ``This company is more dead than alive,'' Mr. Milton says."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Prices of corn and soybeans futures tumbled Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts that parched crops in the Midwest will finally be getting some rain. The western Corn Belt should get light rain Tuesday and Wednesday, and will probably sidestep 90-degree temperatures this week, which could have a ruinous effect, baking already dry fields that have not received much rain in the past three weeks. Prices also were pressured by Monday evening's weekly crop reports, which said that 61% of corn and 55% of the soybean crop is in good to excellent shape. Traders expected the Agriculture Department report to show crop conditions to have deteriorated because of the lack of rain. In addition, prices fell in sympathy with the stock market, which eventually recovered but fell more than 150 points during the session, said Donella Ford, an analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. He said traders were so skittish they didn't want to invest anywhere. Corn for July delivery plunged 30.25 cents to $5.0175 a bushel; September corn fell the 12-cent limit to $4.045 a bushel. August soybeans lost 17.5 cents to $8.205 a bushel; September wheat dropped 9.25 cents to $4.8325 a bushel. ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-product futures prices settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange following sharp gains made during the day's session. August crude ended at $22.38 a barrel, down 10 cents, rebounding from the sell-off that pressured it as low as $20.06 earlier in the day. August crude set a new lifetime high at $20.55 near the opening, but failed to attract sustained buying in the face of solid commercial resistance selling, traders said. Some market pressure may have emerged on news that U.N. Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp said he hoped for an agreement on the aid distribution plan of the Iraqi oil-for-food sale by the end of the week. That statement confirmed the sentiment expressed of U.N. diplomats over the weekend that acceptance of a plan was likely this week, and that Iraqi oil could return to the market by the end of August. August gasoline settled at 65.13 cents a gallon, down 0.43 cent, after the sharp rally that lifted the contract to its lifetime top of 65.70 cents Monday. August heating oil fell 0.54 cent to 57.18 cents a gallon, tracking gasoline. PRECIOUS METALS: Most precious metals settled sharply lower Tuesday after heavy fund selling was sparked by a sharp late recovery in the U.S. stock market, traders and analysts said. Some traders sold precious metals on the belief that a recovery in the U.S. stock market would dampen portfolio-hedge buying of precious metals, traders said. The nearly 330-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this week may have touched off some buying of precious metals earlier in the day by large investors looking to hedge their falling stock portfolios, traders said. Gold for August delivery fell $1.50 to $384.20 an ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex. September silver dropped 22.2 cents to $4.943 an ounce."

Volume slipped to 5.67 billion Hong Kong dollars from the preceding session's HK$6.25 billion. Among the key subindexes, the financials dipped 0.2%. The utilities dropped 0.3%. The property subindex slid 0.08%. And the commercial and industrial subindex retreated 0.2%. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the Chinese Class H shares, ended at 781.64, down 19.08 points. Archie Aucoin, director of sales at Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd., said that the China-related stocks dropped on profit-taking."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Grain and soybean futures prices tumbled Wednesday for the third consecutive day on the Chicago Board of Trade amid expectations that crops will continue to improve as rain sweeps across parched Midwestern fields. Overnight rain that drenched more than 80% of Iowa's crop continues to chase drought-watchers out of the market. Investors believe the rain will help corn crops during the crucial pollination period. Most of the nation's corn and soybean crop is in good to excellent shape despite hot and dry weather. The USDA pegged 60% of the corn crop in at least good condition, with 55% of soybean crops in the same shape. Meanwhile, wheat futures fell on good growing weather for the spring wheat crop and the late-harvested winter wheat. Wheat for September delivery dropped 2.25 cents to $4.81 a bushel; September corn lost 18 cents to $3.865 a bushel; August soybeans dropped 16 cents to $8.025 a bushel. ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-product futures prices settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday amid continued profit taking in the wake of recent gains. August crude settled at $21.80 a barrel, down 58 cents, after falling to a session low at $21.30. The contract fell through support early in the day at $22.00 and again later at $21.80. The market also may have seen some pressure on news that the U.S. hinted that it had no objections to the new Iraqi aid distribution plan. The U.S. showed strong opposition to Baghdad's proposals in a plan submitted two weeks ago. August gasoline futures settled at 63.89 cents a gallon, down 1.16 cent, after rebounding from the session bottom at 63.20 cents a gallon. The contract came under pressure initially on the American Petroleum Institute report, which put gasoline stocks down 804,000 barrels for the latest reporting week, while the Energy Department put the figure down 1.3 million barrels. Traders had called for a draw of 2 million to 3 million barrels. August heating oil fell 0.86 cent to 56.32 cents a gallon, largely trailing the drop in the gasoline and crude, traders said. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled little changed Wednesday, as traders watched the U.S. stock market for signs of metals' next direction. ``The metals were put on the back burner,'' said Ricki Tony, a trader with Credit Suisse in New York, especially given the strong moves in Chicago grain futures, which made the slower-moving precious metals unappealing to many speculative traders. Gold for August delivery ended unchanged at $384.20 an ounce; September silver rose 1.7 cent to $4.960 an ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex."

            "full_text": "The broad measure All Share Index climbed 56 points to 6684, fueled by a 109-point rise in the Industrial Index to 7897. The All Gold Index slumped 36 points to 1808. Early futures interest lifted the stocks to an opening 80-point gain. Relieved that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had ended Tuesday in positive territory, investors began buying again, traders said. But with only 371 million rand in shares trading hands, activity was subdued. A late flurry of buying in the last hour of local trading, sparked by opening equity strength in New York, drove the industrial board more than 40 points higher in a gyrating trading pattern. All eyes remain focused on Wall Street, traders said. Among active stocks, banking group First National Bank Holdings rallied 1.55 rand to 28.05, construction stock Group Five soared 1.25, or 13%, to 11.00 rand and tobacco and luxury goods purveyor Richemont jumped 3.50 rand, or 5.5%, to 67.50, with much of the interest centered from its Swiss base. Gold share prices were upset by a strengthening rand and a general switch by investors into advancing industrial shares. The dollar retreated more than four cents against the rand to 4.3895, triggering an exodus from gold shares. Gold analysts await the outcome of Thursday's quarterly gold results from Anglo American, the world's largest gold producer. In the past week, reported earnings from two other South African mining houses, Gold Fields and Gencor, have been described as disappointing, and analysts feel that if Anglo is unable to match expectations, a hefty sell-off could transpire. Among losing stocks, Gold Fields fell another 4.00 rand to 119.00, and Kloof slipped 1.25 rand to 43.50. Remarking on the latest gyrations on the New York Stock Exchange, London-based investment house Syfrets International said U.S. equities were still overvalued despite recent steep losses. The anticipation of a rise in official U.S. short-term interest rates and poor corporate returns has left Wall Street vulnerable to a further fall of 5% to 10%, Syfrets International said."

            "full_text": "The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index ended the day up 25.9 at 3658.2 on volume of about 534.8 million shares. The benchmark September future was trading at 3660, compared with Tuesday's settlement at 3631 and the FT-SE 250 index of mid-capitalization stocks rose 6.4 to close at 4207.4. The British market started the day sharply higher, but during the latter half of the session the blue-chip index eased back as an early rally on Wall Street stalled. After climbing more than 70 points minutes after the opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began to lose steam and was trading just 16 points higher at the close of trading in London. Traders said investors were cautious Wednesday as they waited for the U.S. financial markets to stabilize. Many were putting off taking positions in the market ahead of Thursday's testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alberta Halina before Congress, where it is hoped the direction of U.S. monetary policy will become more clear. Fears that U.S. mutual fund managers may take cash out of the market were also weighing on investors, traders said. ``No one's particularly keen to do anything at the moment,'' said Credit Lyonnais Laing Strategist Anette Jon. The index's top two gainers, construction-materials company Hampton and telecommunications company Orange bounced back from big losses suffered on Tuesday. Wolseley finished up 4.3% at 439 pence, while Orange climbed 3.3% to 188.5 pence. Scottish Power moved ahead 9 to 316 pence on word it cut its rights issue by half. The utility also said earlier this week it is in discussions with Belgian electricity generator Loehr about the possibility of sharing technological developments. Some of the retailers that came under intense selling pressure Tuesday ended the day higher. Argos recouped 17 at 696 and Next regained 12 at 519. Tobacco company B.A.T Industries climbed 13 to 498 as it benefited from news Tuesday that Philip Morris Cos. of the U.S. posted a 15% increase in net income for the second quarter. Leisure and entertainment group Rank gained momentum on the strength of a ``buy'' recommendation issued by Colin Woodley. Food retailer Tesco rose 2.2% to 284 as speculation died down about a rumored takeover bid for Docks de France. Hanson dropped 3.5 to 157.5 after the company said it acquired Dutch cigar manufacturer Breeding Lumpkins for an undisclosed sum. Continued speculation that Blenheim Group could receive a bid from United News & Media boosted Blenheim's share price up 5 to 443. United News eased 9 to 620. Glisson added 7 at 234 after the company said its half-year pretax profit jumped 17% to &#163;33.9 million from &#163;28.9 million last year. But Iceland Group stumbled 16.9% to 118 on word the company's pretax profit for the first half of the year will likely to be down 10% compared with last year. Iceland posted pretax earnings of &#163;33.6 million pounds for the first six months of 2010. A less-than-positive earnings projection propelled English China down 11 to 243. The company said profit margins in all divisions declined in the first half of the year, caused mainly by low production rates at paper mills. The company supplies coloring pigments to paper producers. English China Clays also said net debt increased to &#163;213 million pounds for the six months ended March 12, 2011"

            "full_text": "U.S. crude oil output fell sharply in the first half of the year, with production from Alaska's enormous fields taking an unexpected, nearly 8% tumble, the American Petroleum Institute reported. One consequence was another jump in the amount of imported petroleum used by Americans, to 52% from 49% of total consumption. The oil-production reports are available on the American Petroleum Institute's World Wide Web site at The nation's production of oil has been tracking downward for more than a decade. But industry analysts were surprised by the rate of decline recorded in the first six months of 2011: 3.1% -- more than double the 1.5% rate in the same period of 2010. And the number of oil-well completions, a barometer of the exploration-and-production sector's health, also slipped abruptly -- by 18% -- even though crude was selling for about $2 a barrel more this spring than last. ``With prices like that, it's not as if people wouldn't have been trying to get oil out of the ground,'' said Kendra Halley, chief economist for Chevron Corp. in San Francisco. ``The question we can't answer yet is whether this is a new trend or a quirk.'' The petroleum institute, which keeps statistics for the industry, had thought the exploration-and-production boom in the Gulf of Mexico would compensate for sluggish activity in the continental U.S. ``But what's going on in the Gulf isn't enough to completely offset the decline onshore in the lower 48,'' said Edelmira Bambi, the institute's chief economist, ``and certainly not enough to make up for Alaska production falling off so very, very quickly.'' Alaska's prolific North Slope fields, among the biggest in the world, were discovered nearly 30 years ago. The Slope's output peaked in 1988, at about two million barrels a day. ``The only thing that companies can do in Alaska is try to slow the rate of decline,'' said Petrina Houchens, an energy analyst with WEFA Group in Eddystone, Pa.. Still, the slide in daily Alaskan output in the first six months to 1.42 million barrels, from 1.53 million barrels in the first half of last year, was greater than anticipated. ``It was surprising, but it's too early to tell if it is going to continue at this pace,'' Mr. Bambi said. Atlantic Richfield Co., the second-largest producer on the North Slope, predicted earlier this year that the Slope's output would fall at an annual rate of 6% for the next five years, though Arco hopes to soon stabilize its own output in Alaska, now at about 400,000 a day. ``We expect that with our planned capital expenditure program of $1.15 billion over the next five years that we can at least get production to level off,'' said a spokesman for the company. In the first six months of the year, total U.S. crude production averaged 6.438 million barrels a day, down from 6.646 million barrels a day in the 2010 period, the petroleum institute said. Demand for petroleum products was up 2.5% -- to slightly more than 18 million barrels a day -- but demand for motor gasoline marked just a 0.5% expansion over last year. ``We had been expecting an increase of 1.5% or so,'' Mr. Bambi said, speculating that the increase in gasoline prices in the late winter and spring might have been a factor. Oil output in the lower 48 states stumbled by a little less than 2% in the six months, a slightly greater rate than in the first half of 2010. ``A lot of that is because so much exploration has switched from oil to natural gas,'' said Jimmy Willie, chief economist for West Texas Research Group in Midland."

Traders said blue-chip stocks were among the more favored issues on the exchange Thursday, by both overseas and local investors. Trading activity was sluggish, however, with investors reluctant to take positions in the market amid worries about the volatile U.S. equity market. The gold index continued to slump, shrugging off bright quarterly results from Anglo American, the world's biggest gold producer. Anglo's gold and uranium division reported a 43% rise in quarterly net profit to 322.7 million rand. Another producer posting stellar earnings also failed to spark buying interest. Free State Consolidated Gold Mines said its quarterly income more than doubled to 126.5 million rand, but its share price eased 15 South African cents to 45.60 rand. Both the rand and the spot bullion price -- the driving force on gold stock price performance -- ended largely flat for the session. The dollar was quoted at 4.3905 rand in late-afternoon European trading, while gold hovered near $384 an ounce. Other retreating shares included Anglo-controlled Vaal Reefs Exploration & Mining, which fell 9.50 rand to 375, and Harmony Gold Mining, which lost 60 cents at 45. Elsewhere, diamond giant De Beers Consolidated Mines rallied 1.75 rand to 142.75; banking group First National Bank Holdings gained 95 cents at 29 rand; and pulp and paper concern Funderburk added 60 cents at 46 rand."

            "full_text": "The Australian share market is about to get its first investment-bank play, but some analysts and fund managers say the stock looks too pricey. Sydney-based Macquarie Bank plans to list its shares on the Australian Stock Exchange April 10, 2011 bank's shares already are traded among professional investors off the stock market. Because the bank doesn't need to raise capital, it has decided to list its existing shares on the exchange rather than offer new ones. The driving force behind the listing is a ``request from our shareholders'' for a more liquid market, says Allena Dennis, Harkey's managing director. Among Grimaldo's biggest holders is Hill Samuel & Co., a unit of Lloyds TSB Group of the U.K., which owns a 13.9% stake. Harkey and Lloyds are in talks over the interpretation of a longstanding agreement relating to whether Grimaldo can vet the buyer of that stake. But Mr. Dennis believes the sale of the stake by Lloyds is ``inevitable.'' Established in early 1985, Macquarie Bank has 31 business units, including the third-largest stockbroker in Australia, based on total volume of shares traded, and a large fund-management business. It also offers financing services for gold producers, runs a large bullion-hedging operation and trades base metals. And it is expanding into Asia, including recently announced joint ventures with Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank in Malaysia to carry out fund management and futures trading. Harkey's shares have been changing hands lately at 6.80 Australian dollars (US$5.37), or about 11 times earnings of 61 Australian cents a share for the year ended December 11, 2010 for a bonus issue of stock in June. At current prices the bank would have a market capitalization of about A$1 billion and represent 0.3% of the All Ordinaries share index. Ellinger Ian, an analyst at brokerage firm J.B. Were & Son, likes the bank's track record (return on equity has been above 20% in recent years), its management and its diverse portfolio of activities. But at current levels, he says, the stock is ``quite pricey.'' The bank is going to be ``the only listed investment bank in Australia,'' he adds, ``so there's absolutely nothing to compare it to.'' However, a look at a basket of 11 listed commercial banks in Australia gives some idea of relative price. Those banks are trading at an average of 8.5 times fiscal 2011 earnings. Mr. Ian expects Harkey's earnings for the fiscal year ending December 11, 2010 slip to 60 Australian cents a share, putting the prospective price/earnings multiple at 11. By comparison, the basket of banks trades at an average of eight times Were's fiscal 2012 forecasts. Mr. Ian is telling clients who have Macquarie shares to hold on to them. Investors wanting stock should ``buy it, but at lower levels,'' he says, adding that any divestment by Lloyds could create ``downward pressure'' on the stock. To be sure, some holders think the bank is good value. Gregorio Arnoldo, executive director of equities at Mercantile Mutual Investment Management, already holds about 2% of Macquarie's stock and is inclined to add to his holding at current prices. Among other things, he likes noises coming from the bank's management that the annual dividend may be increased. In its latest fiscal year ended December 11, 2010 paid a dividend of 36 Australian cents per share, or a yield of 5%, unadjusted for the June bonus issue of shares. Brooke Arnoldo at Rothschild Australia Asset Management also likes the bank for its ``strong management'' and its ``diversity'' of activities, but at 11 times fiscal 2011 earnings, she says, the stock is ``definitely not looking cheap.'' Petrina Mozell, head of equities at Perpetual Funds Management, is another fan, but given the current shaky world stock market environment he would be a buyer at A$6 a share or below. ``There's better relative value elsewhere at current prices,'' he says, preferring to put his money on two of Australia's big commercial banks, Commonwealth Bank and National Australia Bank, both of which currently offer higher dividend yields than Grimaldo."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Grain and soybean futures plunged Thursday for a fourth consecutive day on the Chicago Board of Trade after torrential rains fell in Illinois and alleviated drought fears elsewhere in the Midwest. The weather that brought 12 inches of rain to western Iowa and 16 inches to northern Illinois since Tuesday is moving away, but forecasts are for plants to receive another inch overnight. Crop damage is expected to be minimal because plants have been so starved for moisture, said analyst Martyn Foreman with AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.. Rain early next week should fall over 70% of the Midwest, wetting areas of the central Corn Belt that have missed rain so far. No long-term periods of extreme heat are predicted and Monday's crop progress report is expected to show improved conditions. New crop grain and soybean exports were considered strong, but they could not stem the weather-related slide. Corn for September delivery fell 14 cents to $3.725 a bushel; August soybeans lost 27.5 cents to $7.77 a bushel; September wheat dropped 6 cents to $4.75; July oats lost 3.25 cents to $2.0625 a bushel. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange Thursday, pressured by the United Nations approval of Iraq's aid distribution plan for the oil-for-food deal. August crude ended at $21.68 a barrel, down 12 cents, rebounding from a low of $21.41 early in the session. The initial selling appeared to be a continuation of Wednesday's weakness. U.N. approval of the aid distribution plan -- which could mean Iraqi crude will begin flowing by the end of August -- has been a major hurdle in the implementation of the oil-for-food plan, though U.N. diplomats had expected an agreement to be reached this week. August gasoline fell 0.2 cent to 63.87 cents a gallon, recovering from the sell-off that pressured the contract to a low for the session of 62.85 cents. August heating oil rose 0.42 cent to 56.74 cents a gallon. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled higher Thursday after an unexpectedly wide monthly U.S. trade deficit sparked some buying. The May U.S. trade deficit was reported Thursday at $10.88 billion, wider than the $8 billion expected by many economists. Meanwhile, traders and analysts said that remarks before the Senate by Federal Reserve Chairman Alberta Halina had little impact on the metals markets. Gold for August delivery climbed 40 cents to $384.60 an ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex. September silver rose 4 cents to $5 an ounce."

            "full_text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rose 66.94 to 5006.94, after rising 19.41 Wednesday. Advancing issues beat decliners, 544 to 283. Volume was 69.3 million shares valued at $1.14 billion Canadian, up from Wednesday's 65.2 million shares valued at C$1.04 billion. Toronto slightly underperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.30 to 5464.18. All 14 of the TSE's stock sub-indexes rose, reflecting reduced fears over inflation and the negative impact it can have on the economy. The financial-services sector in particular had a strong day, rising 1.98%, on the combination of Mr. Halina's inflation outlook and Toronto-Dominion Bank's massive buyback plan of up to 30 million of its common shares. With Mr. Halina indicating that inflation appears under control, interest-rate fears in the bond and equity markets dissipated. In turn, bond prices rose on the day, taking banks stocks with them in traditional fashion. Furthermore, Toronto-Dominion's buyback plan signaled to equity investors that other banks might follow suit to enhance shareholder value, observers say. Toronto-Dominion's stock surged 1.30 to 25.30. Besides reduced interest-rate fears, Toronto's overall gain also reflects ``a fairly (typical) rally after a normal correction,'' said Nygaard Klingensmith, portfolio strategist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc. ``You don't want to read too much into today,'' Mr. Klingensmith said. The performance of gold stocks seems to support this view. The gold sub-index surged 2.05%, despite reduced fears over inflation and a sluggish gold price. Typically, bullion stocks would suffer in this kind of environment. But Mr. Klingensmith points out that some gold stocks have dropped 25% over the past few months, hence the sector's rebound Thursday."

A total of 59 issues gained by their daily permissible highs while 25 issues fell by the daily limits. ``It took a long time to see the market swung to positive territory. Recent losers, such as blue chips and other cheap large-capitalized issues, gave an upward momentum to the market,'' said Kim Soon-Sylvia, an analyst at LG Securities Co.. A major factor behind the day's swing was easing jitters among investors who bought shares on margin loans, he said. Among the gainers, semiconductor maker Samsung Electronics gained 1,200 won to 70,000 won."

            "full_text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The chairman of Taiwan's Over-the-Counter Securities Exchange is seeking a fivefold increase or more in the exchange's daily trading volume by the end of the year. Ballesteros Hsiao-Plumley said he hopes to lift average daily trading volume on the fledgling OTC market to four billion to five billion New Taiwan dollars (US$145.1 million to US$181.4 million) by year end, from NT$745.2 million (US$27 million) in June. Mr. Ballesteros, who was president of the Taiwan Stock Exchange during an extended bull run in the late 1980s, will pursue his target by aggressively promoting the OTC market to smaller Taiwan companies. ``We hope to attract high-quality small- and medium-size enterprises to list,'' Mr. Ballesteros said. ``There is a lot of room for expansion.'' The exchange hopes to boost listings on the OTC exchange to 100 companies by the end of 2011 from the current 63, with further increases to 300 companies by the end of 2013. New listings must be approved by both the OTC exchange and Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission. With increasing liquidity, the expansion in listings may attract more investors, many of whom have so far shunned the OTC market. The market's high-growth companies, which often require a longer investment horizon, seem to have appealed more to institutions than to individual investors. Institutional investors account for about 14% of the OTC market's capitalization -- more than half of them foreign institutions, Mr. Ballesteros said, whereas institutions account for only 8% of the main board's capitalization."

Lloyds Chemists rose 6 pence to 481 pence after the Department of Trade and Industry announced it has rejected both German-based Gehe's and UniChem's bids for Lloyds, unless they each dispose of some of their wholesale pharmaceutical businesses. UniChem has already responded by stating it will look to meet the DTI requirements, while Gehe has said it will assess the situation. UniChem fell 4 pence to 263 pence. Royal Bank of Scotland's shares rose 6 1/2 pence to 491 1/2 pence after announcing it has settled the litigation brought against it by the liquidators of former customer, Wallace Smith Trust Co..

The gold sector failed to share the wider market's ebullience, however, with some miners losing ground as the rand put in a robust performance against the dollar. Alberta Halina, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, appeared before Congress Thursday and said he didn't see any signs of a strong increase in inflationary pressures in the U.S. That reduced fears that the U.S. central bank will aggressively lift rates soon. Anglo American gained 3.00 rand to 259.00, and fellow mining heavyweight De Beers Consolidated Mines climbed by 4.75 rand to 147.00. One of the most active stocks Friday was petroleum concern Engen, which rose 25 cents to 29.45 cents on turnover of 1.2 million shares. Brokers said the shares apparently changed hands as part of an options deal. Fellow oil sector stock Sasol also rose, putting on 1.10 rand to 46.20.

            "full_text": "HONG KONG -- Paulene Berrios, chief executive of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, said he plans to retire effective October 13, 2011 Mr. Berrios, who is 49 years old and was appointed to the post in 1991, is credited with playing an important role in improving transparency and fairness at the stock exchange. He is also widely viewed as a cautious administrator, stressing in public statements that the stock exchange shouldn't try to impose radical reforms or new products on the market, but should let change develop gradually. That go-slow approach to market reform met resistance from Antoinette Ellis, chairman of Hong Kong's market regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission. When the SFC unveiled a blueprint for market development in February, Mr. Berrios and Edgardo Cavanaugh, the stock exchange chairman, strongly criticized Mr. Ellis for trying to usurp the stock exchange's market-development role and trying to impose changes from the top. That public battle has since subsided. In a press release Mr. Ellis praised ``Mr. Berrios's patience, perseverance and leadership,'' which have enhanced the stock market's transparency and risk management. Observers say Mr. Berrios sometimes battled behind the scenes for improved transparency. Last year, in a closed-door meeting Mr. Berrios argued that a listed company should be required to disclose if a director had a previous criminal conviction in another country, says a member of the exchange's ruling council. At the time, other staff at the exchange had ruled that a company shouldn't be required to disclose a director's prior criminal conviction provided that conviction was in another jurisdiction. Mr. Batts praised Mr. Berrios's role in spearheading an improved trading system, and the launch of stock options. Under the stock exchange's ``automatic order matching and execution'' system, market authorities can more readily scrutinize trading to uncover abuses and malpractices by brokers. In the last year, the SFC has prosecuted dozens of brokers for malpractices, thanks in part to the exchange's new trading system. In a statement, Mr. Berrios didn't say why he had decided to retire, and he specified no future plans. Mr. Berrios wasn't available for comment. Before taking his stock exchange post, he was chief executive of the Hong Kong Securities Clearing Co. and had been a stockbroker. His departure comes at a critical time as mainland Chinese companies steadily increase their presence on the Hong Kong exchange. Market observers note that after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule next year the exchange will need to ensure these Chinese companies adhere to the high standards of transparency and corporate governance Mr. Berrios championed."

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Grain and soybean futures settled lower Friday on the Vastopolis Board of Trade, continuing their weeklong slide amid prospects that recent rains will leave the corn crop in better condition than has been seen in more than a year. Rain has fallen over much of the region this week. The rain and warm temperatures are hitting just as corn begins pollinating and needs a lot of moisture, said analyst Dillon Bonnett at AgResource Co. in Vastopolis. ``The perception is that we have a good corn crop. Two-thirds to 75% of the crop is great,'' he said. Some areas of the region have been drenched with more than 10 inches of rain, but most flooding was isolated and away from fields. And crops have been so dry that the downpors likely will cause little damage, said analyst Danae Powe at Fimat Futures USA Inc. in Vastopolis. Corn futures also fell in anticipation of Friday evening's Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report, which showed the number of cows fed corn had dropped by about 15% over the last year because of historically high feed prices. Soybeans and wheat futures fell in sympathy with corn, analysts said. Corn for September delivery fell 4.75 cents to $3.6775 a bushel; August soybeans dropped 3 cents to $7.74 a bushel; and September wheat lost 15.5 cents to $4.595 a bushel. In other commodities markets: ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-product futures prices settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as speculators trimmed their positions. August crude settled at $21 a barrel, down 68 cents, after sliding to a session low at $20.85. Traders said many investors were paring their holdings ahead of the contract's expiration on Monday. August gasoline fell 1.46 cents to 62.41 cents a gallon; August heating oil settled at 56.02 cents a gallon, down 0.72 cent. PRECIOUS METALS: Gold futures advanced Friday, while silver fell after commodity funds sold roughly 1,000 contracts of September silver around midday. August gold rose 70 cents to $385.30 an ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex; September silver fell 3.5 cents to $4.965 an ounce."

Trading value fell to 895.1 million Canadian dollars from C$1.14 billion a day earlier. Toronto outperformed the New York market, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 37.36 to 5426.82. Fredda Mantooth, senior trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc., attributed Toronto's fairly strong performance to an improved earnings outlook for the banks and renewed expectations that the price of gold is on the rebound. By shaving 0.25 percentage point off overnight lending rates -- the rates financial institutions charge each other to borrow money -- the Bank of Canada is looking to spur on the economy. In turn, this could boost demand for bank loans and lead to improved earnings in the sector, Mr. Mantooth said. The banking sector rose 0.91% to lead all stock groups, with Toronto-Dominon Bank gaining 0.30 to 25.60.

            "full_text": "If ever there was a psychological barrier for the Dow industrials, ``Dow 1000'' was it. The average had knocked on the door of 1000 repeatedly for six years, but could never close above that ``magic'' level. For example, the industrials closed at 995.15 on October 21, 2010 and at 985.21 on August 15, 2011 There were also close calls in May 1969. But no cigar -- until the euphoria of 1972. Many investors active today will remember 1972. Ricki Trujillo was president, ``The Godfather'' was packing them in at the movies, and Americans were tuned to ``All in the Family'' on television. The Watergate scandal, which later destroyed the Trujillo administration, was only a cloud on the horizon. The Vietnam War was a major problem, but on the day the 1000 barrier fell, North Vietnam had agreed that its representative would meet with U.S. negotiator Herma Kessinger for a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. The re-election of Mr. Trujillo over Georgeanna Harbin had occurred a week earlier. And the economy was doing well. Economic growth was unusually strong, inflation was moderate and interest rates were low. In the stock market, it was the heyday of the ``Nifty Fifty,'' stocks that were so popular that it was said they were ``one decision'' stocks: Buy them, and never worry about selling. Among the most popular stocks of the day were Xerox, Glen, IBM and McDonald's. Not long after the industrial average punctured the 1000 mark, a recession occurred and the brutal bear market of 1973-74 set in, pushing the average all the way down to 577.60 in December 1974. It would be late 1982 -- a full decade after the 1000 milestone was first passed -- before the industrials rose above 1000 to stay. --Johnetta Hames"

Belt, a broker at Dao Heng Securities Ltd.. Coming back from the weekend, investors had little market-moving news to trade on, Mr. Belt said. But he said that last Friday's slip on Wall Street gave participants an opportunity to engage in mild selling. Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 37.36 to 5426.82. Volume dropped to 3.68 billion Hong Kong dollars from the preceding session's HK$5.49 billion. HSBC Holdings rose 50 Hong Kong cents to HK$121.50 while its subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd. dropped 50 cents to HK$76.25. Among the key subindexes, the financials posted the only gain, rising 0.04%. Devon Wynne, director at Vickers Ballas Hong Kong Ltd., said with scant news in the market, participants turned to specific stocks, notably in the banking and property sectors. `The upcoming interim results are attracting interest to the banks,'' he said. He said investors are anticipating a rash of good earnings reports. The utilities lost 0.3%. HongKong Telecommunications Ltd. slipped 5 cents to HK$12.90 while China Light & Power fell 10 cents to HK$33.40. The property subindex plunged 0.9%. Developer Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. fell 25 cents to HK$54 while Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. fell HK$1 to HK$74.25. A slower property market is damping interest in property shares, Mr. Wynne said. And the commercial and industrial subindex slipped 0.5%. Conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. dropped 60 cents to HK$47.10 while Wharf (Holdings) Ltd. climbed 30 cents to HK$27.30. Traders said they weren't aware of any reason for the move. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the Chinese Class H, ended at 790.20, down 3.48 points. Among stocks, bullion retailer Tem Fat Hing Fung Holdings Ltd. scorched its way up the most active list, notching HK$105 million in volume. Its shares rose 4 cents to HK$1.55. The traders said speculators were behind the rise in prices. Infrastructure builder Hopewell Holdings Ltd. bucked market trend and gained 7.5 cents to HK$4.375."

            "full_text": "Corn and soybean futures settled lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade -- a sixth consecutive drop -- amid one of the sunniest outlooks for crops in years. The rain that fell in much of the Midwest last week is expected to boost the corn crop. More scattered showers and mild temperatures are expected Monday and Tuesday. Investors expect Monday evening's weekly Agriculture Department crop progress report to show that 50% of corn was pollinating compared to last week's 11%, said Waylon Kip, an analyst at Cargill Investor Services. Ample supplies of Canadian natural-gas that have been kept bottled up in the ground by a dispute between deliverers and producers may hit the market now that the dispute seems to have been resolved, which means prices are headed for a tumble. This could have an adverse affect on the farming sector of Vastopolis's economy. Friday's Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report further pressured prices, showing 21% fewer cattle were being given feed than a year ago when prices were about half the level of Monday's. Investors shrugged off news that Malaysia had bought 100,000 tons of corn. But exports sent wheat futures higher. Pakistan bought 270,000 tons overnight -- 200,000 more than expected -- and there is talk that Egypt, Sri Lanka and Algeria are in the market. Corn for September delivery fell 12 cents to $3.5575 a bushel; August soybeans lost 6.25 cents to $7.6775 a bushel; and September wheat rose 1 cent to $4.605 a bushel. In other commodities markets: ENERGY: Crude-oil futures settled higher on their expiration on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while refinery products ended the day mixed. August crude rose 40 cents to $21.40 a barrel, after hitting its highest mark of the day at $21.70 in the final minutes. August gasoline gained 0.35 cent to 62.76 cents a gallon after rallying late in the day to as high as 62.90 cents; August heating oil fell 0.17 cent to 55.85 cents a gallon. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious-metals futures settled firmer as losses in U.S. stocks touched off short-covering buying of gold and silver contracts. On the Comex division of the Nymex, gold for August delivery rose 20 cents to $385.50 an ounce, while September silver climbed 5 cents to $5.015 an ounce. Short covering refers to purchases made to reverse short sale positions, bets that prices would decline."

During the session, the FT-SE 100 reached a high of 3707.3 and dropped to a low of 3672.2. The benchmark September futures contract ended the day at 3680, down from Friday's close at 3708. The FT-SE 250 index of midcapitalization stocks fell 19 points to end the day at 4231. ``The market is being whipped around by futures (trading),'' said Markita Pardo, equity strategist at HSBC James Capel. ``And on a minute by minute, day by day basis, if Wall Street goes down, so do we.'' Share prices fell from the outset, tracking the Dow Jones Industrial Average's 37-point decline Friday. Adding to market jitters was the 470-point drop on Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index. Prices continued to lose ground, and hit the session low after the Dow industrials lost more than 50 points in early Cornertown trading. At the close of trading in London, the industrial average was down 35 points. Meanwhile, a host of blue-chip shareholders' meetings, including British Steel, De La Rue and National Power, are scheduled this week adding to concerns about earnings results. Among the earliest to report was Thorn EMI, which said its pretax profit for the first quarter ended March 12, 2011 13% to &#163;68 million from &#163;60.1 million a year ago. However, the increase was at bottom end of consensus expectations, dragging its share price down 42 to 1693. British Gas rose 4 1/2 to 190 1/2 as speculation mounts that gas industry regulator Ofgas will soften its price controls on the TransCo distribution unit. Ofgas said Monday it would publish its final proposals in mid-August. British Gas later criticized the regulators delay. Royal Sun Alliance was among the biggest gainers on the FT-SE 100. Royal Sun Alliance, the result of the merger between Royal Insurance Holdings and Sun Alliance Group, started trading Friday. Royal Sun Alliance advanced 1 1/2 to 372. A late gainer on the market was Costain, after shareholders approved a &#163;74 million rescue package despite opposition from one of the company's main investors. Costain rallied 7 to 46."

On Friday, Exor, the direct investment arm of the Agnelli group, announced it had purchased a 4.8% stake in the Hong Kong trading firm for about 30 million U.S. dollars. The Agnelli group controls automotive manufacturer Fiat SpA, which had revenue of US$50 billion in 2010. Exor purchased the shares from the Fung family at seven Hong Kong dollars a share, or a 4.8% discount from their price of HK$7.35 (95 U.S. cents) on Friday at the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Albrecht Schaller, president of Exor, said the firm hoped this investment would be a prelude to joint investments with Li & Fung in Asia. Li & Fung, which had revenue of HK$2.81 billion for the six months ended March 12, 2011 an extensive distribution network in Asia and strong trading channels to the U.S. Mr. Schaller said the Agnelli group would help introduce Li & Fung to distribution channels in Europe, an area where Li & Fung has been weak. Exor, which makes investments both in listed and unlisted companies, has been investing in Asia for four years. Excluding its investment in Li & Fung, Exor has invested about US$100 million in the region. Its investments include a stake in Distacon Communications Ltd., a privately owned Hong Kong cellular-telephone operator and Guoco Group Ltd., which owns Hong Kong's third-largest bank, Dao Heng Bank Ltd."

            "full_text": "Monsanto Co.'s heavily promoted insect-resistant cotton is running into a few bugs. The bugs, potentially damaging bollworms, have cropped up in unusually high numbers this season throughout the Cotton Belt, even on plants grown from Monsanto's genetically engineered Bollgard seeds -- advertised as all but bollworm-proof. The timing of the infestation couldn't be worse: This is the first year that U.S. farmers planted commercial crops of engineered cotton, corn and potatoes, and any problems could cast doubt on the new technology. Already, some Texas farmers who paid a premium for the fancy seeds and thought they wouldn't have to use insecticides on their cotton say St. Louis-based Monsanto owes them at least an apology. ``If Monsanto doesn't clarify their position very quickly, as far as compensating my growers for this additional expense ... they won't sell another product in our area, I promise you that,'' says Paulene Hubbs, a crop consultant in East Bernard, Texas. His clients, Mr. Hubbs says, ``are irate.'' Agriculture experts say it's far too early to pronounce the Bollgard seeds a failure or a success, or to tell whether Monsanto should bet the farm on the fledgling genetically engineered-seed market, currently a small share of the chemical giant's business. U.S. cotton crops won't be harvested until late summer and early fall. And this growing season is extraordinary, with bollworms showing up in all cotton plants at 20 to 50 times the levels that typically trigger spraying with chemical insecticides. ``People's expectations were very, very high,'' says Raquel Carnes, a product-development manager for Monsanto. ``But you can never guarantee 100% control 100% of the time.'' Several farmers in Texas, however, claim that is precisely what Monsanto did. One brochure mailed to customers who bought the Bollgard seeds advises, ``Just relax. Bollgard will protect your cotton.'' And over a picture of a small bollworm is the headline, ``You'll see these in your cotton and that's okay. Don't spray.'' A natural poison, engineered into the Bollgard seed, is supposed to be 95% effective against bollworms. Executives at Monsanto say they're aware of the farmers' unhappiness. Rolando Weintraub, chairman of Delta & Pine Land Co., the cotton-seed company that helped develop the engineered seeds, says he's received a slew of complaints, too. ``I think there's a perception problem out there,'' Mr. Weintraub says. ``But the technology has not failed.'' He and Monsanto point out that Monsanto never said farmers wouldn't have to spray at all. And not all cotton farmers are unhappy. ``I wouldn't give it up for anything,'' says Fransisca Loveday, who planted several thousand acres of the Bollgard seed on his land in Mississippi this spring and last year grew the cotton that produced the engineered seeds for Delta & Pine. ``It has worked unbelievably well'' at controlling bollworms. The Bollgard gene is derived from a organism common in soil and known as Bt, or Bacillus thuringiensis. Its use in the production of seeds was approved last October by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, over the objections of such advocacy groups as the Union of Concerned Scientists, who called for further study to ensure the insect protection really worked. Monsanto is marketing other Bt gene seeds this year, and ``if Bt cotton fails, and farmers who tried it are burned, that might hurt acceptance of the technology,'' says Christopher Block, an analyst at BioScience Securities Inc., an Orinda, Calif., investment firm that specializes in agricultural biotechnology. The scientists' union, in fact, is calling on the EPA to suspend sales, alleging that gene-altered cotton is ``failing in the fields.'' The agency says it is monitoring the situation. Monsanto, a leader in agricultural biotechnology, knows it has a problem on its hands. When word of the bollworm invasion reached Wall Street on March 27, 2011 stock of Delta & Pine Land, based in Scott, Miss., took a one-day, 18.5% tumble. Monsanto's stock felt only a pinch from the news, sliding 7.4%. But for Monsanto, the ``problem is down the road,'' says Jami Wiley, an analyst with Smith Barney. ``If genetic technology doesn't work on a product like this, it calls into question the whole long-term strategy of the company.'' Much of the problem, however, may lie in the product's cost, not its performance. In Texas, Mr. Hubbs, the crop consultant, says his ``neck is on the line'' because he urged clients to buy the Monsanto seeds, which meant paying a ``technology fee'' of $32 an acre in addition to the cost of basic, nonengineered seeds. The fee, according to Monsanto, is supposed to be less than what a farmer would pay per acre to spray insecticides on cotton grown from conventional seeds. Last year, the average U.S. cotton farmer spent $150 an acre on several rounds of spraying, according to Delta & Pine. So even if a farmer has to spray his Bt cotton fields one or two times this year, Monsanto says, he will end up saving money. The season, however, isn't over yet. ``I think the technology is good, but only time will tell if it pays at $32 an acre,'' says Rozanne D. Pat, an entomologist with Texas A&M University's Texas Agricultural Extension Service in Foote Christia. Other companies that offer Bt seeds don't charge as much. Mycogen Corp. of San Diego introduced Bt corn this year -- and it is locked in a patent battle with Monsanto. Mycogen charged just $1 to $2 more per acre than the going cost for conventional seeds. Still, Mycogen's chairman and chief executive officer, Jesica Barrientos, says he's sympathetic to Monsanto's plight. ``This is the first shot out of the gun for this technology,'' he says, ``and you have to expect a few bumps.'' Of the 15 million acres of cotton being grown in the U.S. this year, some two million acres were planted with Bollgard seeds. Delta & Pine says about 10,000 of those are in Texas, where extremely high temperatures may be contributing to the bollworms' prevalence. The next challenge for cotton in coming weeks will be the budworms, against which Bollgard is supposed to be completely effective. ``That will be the real test,'' says Delta & Pine's Mr. Weintraub. Meanwhile, Monsanto has sent teams of agents on the road to meet with disgruntled farmers. It also dispatched Fontaine last week urging extra-vigilant scouting for pests. ``The Bollgard gene is performing as well as we expected it to under the conditions out there this year,'' says Briana Fort, Monsanto's business director for cotton. ``There are just some people who don't want to accept that.''"

            "full_text": "TORONTO -- Inco Ltd. and Cominco Ltd. reported higher net income for the second quarter, helped by steps taken in anticipation of copper's recent plunge in price. Inco, a Toronto nickel and copper producer, reported second-quarter earnings of US$61 million, or 47 cents a share, up 11% from $55 million, also 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were $865 million, up 1% from $856 million. The company said its average realized copper price in the second quarter was $1.17 a pound, down 11% from $1.31 a year earlier. Copper prices have dropped since Sumitomo Corp. last month announced a $1.8 billion loss from unauthorized copper trading, and now stand at about 89 cents a pound. Inco benefited from higher realized second-quarter nickel prices, which averaged $3.79 a pound, up from $3.65 a year earlier. Inco's earnings were in line with a First Call analysts' consensus estimate. An Inco spokesman said the company was braced for a decline in copper prices in light of the copper market's supply-and-demand picture. Inco said it bought put options last year, which ``provide a minimum copper price realization of $1.10 a pound for a significant portion of the company's planned 2011 copper deliveries.'' Cominco, a base-metals producer based in Vancouver, British Columbia, said it also had purchased securities that shield the company from lower copper prices. The move added eight million Canadian dollars (US$5.9 million) to the company's second-quarter earnings, it said, and Cominco has agreed to sell forward 25,300 metric tons, or 24% of the company's copper production for the next year, at an average price of C$1.01 a pound. A metric ton is 2,204 pounds. Cominco reported second-quarter earnings, excluding nonrecurring items, of C$21 million, or 23 cents a share, up 17% from earnings of C$18 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Including nonrecurring items, Cominco's second-quarter earnings were C$106 million, or C$1.24 a share. Sales were C$399.3 million, up 13% from C$352.8 million a year earlier. Results were a little below expectations. Teck Corp., a Vancouver base and precious-metals producer, reported second-quarter earnings of C$19.7 million, or 20 Canadian cents a share, up 9% from earnings of C$18.1 million, also 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed to C$187.4 million, up 3% from C$181.7 million. Higher output of gold and base metals was offset by lower copper prices, Andrew said, but the company also moved to cushion the blow of lower copper prices. Andrew said that as of March 12, 2011 had sold forward 44 million pounds of copper, or 25% of its production, at US$1.09 a pound."

            "full_text": "Corn and soybean futures prices ended six days of losses Tuesday, settling higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after surprising new data indicated that the corn crop has improved little over the past week, despite steady rains in the Midwest. An Agriculture Department report released late Monday showed 61% of the nation's corn was in good or excellent shape, a number that has changed little in the past four weeks. Analysts had been expecting better results. Soybean plants actually suffered, with 13 percent of the crop in poor to very poor condition, slightly worse than the 11 percent from last week. ``People are concerned with the scraggly looking beans. Beans look stunted,'' said Stevie Bryan, a trader with E.D. & F. Man International Futures in Chicago. Crops were expected to improve greatly because rain had soaked ground that had been dry for three weeks, but the late planting, cool spring and dry weather had taken too much of a toll, said Richelle Woodley, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago. Wheat futures prices sank after China canceled a purchase of 725,687 tons of hard red winter wheat, Mr. Bryan said. The cancellation was expected because China has complained the hard red winter wheat is infected with a fungus, but it still lent a bearish tone. Corn for September delivery rose 5.75 cents to $3.615 a bushel; September soybeans gained 12 cents to $7.64 a bushel; September wheat fell 6.75 cents to $4.5375 a bushel. In other commodities markets: ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-product futures settled slightly higher Tuesday in thin trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, helped by expectations of supportive data in the weekly inventory reports. September crude oil settled at $21.01 a barrel, up 22 cents, after jumping to $21.10 in the final minutes on a burst of speculative buying ahead of the American Petroleum Institute report, due out after the market close Tuesday. Expectations for a draw in U.S crude stocks as well as some technical buying helped buoy the market during the day, traders said. August unleaded gasoline rose 0.32 to settle at 63.08 cents a gallon; August heating oil gained 0.09 cent to end at 55.94 cents a gallon. PRECIOUS METALS: Prices of precious-metal futures settled mixed in light trading on the Comex division of the Nymex as the weak tone of the U.S. stock markets supported gold but silver was weakened by technical selling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.39 Tuesday to 5,346.55. Gold was supported by some portfolio-hedge buying prompted by the poor performance of U.S. stocks, said Bettina Stivers, metals analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. Some traders, however, interpreted the stock market as a signal of falling U.S. industrial demand, she said, and sold silver, which has widespread industrial uses. On the Comex division of the Nymex, gold for August delivery finished unchanged at $385.50 an ounce, while September silver fell 4.5 cents to $4.970 an ounce."

            "full_text": "The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 27.1 at 3708.4 on volume of 514.3 million shares. The benchmark September futures ended the trading day at 3705, compared with Monday's close at 3677. The FT-SE 250 index of mid-capitalization stocks rose 5.9 to 4236.9. Investors in London cheered the stability of the U.S. market early Tuesday and were encouraged by gains in the Asian equity markets. ``The Dow Jones Industrial Average was quite firm in the afternoon, and good news from a number of companies really pulled the index up,'' said Rosenda Starnes, investment director at Gerrard Vivian Gray. ``Predominately, there were one or two big moves, as some stocks rallied and others were really struggling.'' Traders said stocks gained additional strength from the Treasury Department's &#163;2 billion auction of five-year gilt stock that received was 4.8 times oversubscribed. But pharmaceutical and bank sectors took center stage Tuesday, traders said. The drug sector, representing the FT-SE 350, rose 1.5% to close at 5173.8, as giant Glaxo Wellcome rallied 20 1/2 to 911 1/2. The drug giant said Tuesday its anti-HIV drug Epivir has been cleared for production following an independent study by the Data and Safety Monitoring Board. Meanwhile, Vivien James's Ms. Starnes attributed the banking sector's gains to optimism ahead of the release of corporate earnings results, due out in the next three weeks. The banking sector ended the day at 4138.9, up 1.2%. ``Lloyds TSB kicks off the season on Friday and there are expectations for some quite big dividend increases,'' she said. ``Also, the sector has been in the doldrums a little lately.'' Shares in HSBC Holdings rose nearly 2.5% to close at 1068 following the announcement that its Hong Kong subsidiary, HSBC Americas, posted net income of $175 million for the first six months of 2011. Elsewhere, the debut of Allied Carpets on the London Stock Exchange sparked strong buying interest. Its share price surged to 234 from its initial offering price of 219. Rival Houston climbed 23 to 547 after it announced Tuesday that sales in the first 12 weeks of 2011 are up 33% over the same period in 2010."

            "full_text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index fell 53.09 to 4918.59, after dropping 33.32 Monday. Declining issues led advancers, 522 to 271. Volume totaled 67.5 million shares valued at 1.06 million Canadian dollars, up from Monday's 52.5 million shares valued at C$838.9 million. Toronto lagged New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 44.39 to 5346.55. Northern Telecom highlighted Tuesday's bearish tone with a steep price decline, just one day after another major high-technology stock, Newbridge, led the market lower. Northern Telecom sunk 4.80 to 65.20, after the company's second-quarter earnings of 42 U.S. cents a share fell shy of investors' expectations of between 43 cents and 44 cents a share, analysts said. A slight thinning of gross profit margins also weighed on the stock, they said. Newbridge continued its slump, falling 2.10 to 56.90. But the decline paled compared with Monday's plunge of 8.50, sparked by a downgrade of the stock by a U.S. brokerage firm. Toronto's industrial-products stock group, which is heavily weighted with technology issues, led declining sub-indexes for the second consecutive day, dropping 2.14%. Almost all other groups fell, with only the transportation sector rising 0.22%. The market's unkind reaction to Northern Telecom, despite the slight difference between expectations and the actual profit amount, suggests investors are highly sensitive to earnings in making investment decisions, said Cleo Walters, chief strategist at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion Inc. ``The market is definitely in correction mode, and we think the bearish tone will continue until October,'' Mr. Walters said. Comments by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alberta Halina about potential upward wage pressures in the future, due to a tight U.S. jobless rate, might have also contributed to the equity sell-off, both in Canada and the U.S. Investors could take these comments to signal possible interest-rate increases in the U.S., observers reason."

Trading was robust, with volume rising to 452 million rand worth of shares. The fragile rand slid to a three-and-a-half month low against the dollar Wednesday, pressured by losses in the local bond market and the reserve bank's failure to support the currency. In late European trading, the dollar was quoted at 4.5535 rand, off slightly off its session high of 4.5600 rand but up from late Tuesday's settlement at 4.5350 rand. Rumors about rising domestic interest rates faded Wednesday, and with them went the market's buying interest in the rand. The government's lack of intervention in the currency markets worried investors, who have complained that the government has done little or nothing to arrest the currency's recent slide, traders said. Blue chips were among the heaviest losers, with diamond behemoth De Beers Consolidated Mines giving back all Tuesday's strong gains; its shares ended down 3.75 rand at 131.25. Elsewhere, mining and investment house Anglovaal dropped 4.50 rand to 134.50, while construction group Murray & Roberts tumbled 50 cents to a new 2011 low of 15 rand. Classic rand hedge stocks, whose earnings are largely denominated in foreign currencies, managed to hold steady at Tuesday's levels. Swiss-based tobacco and luxury goods concern Richemont ended flat at 69.75 rand on volume of 266,000 shares. Gold shares, which normally climb when the dollar rises at the expense of the rand, ended the day with sharp losses. Traders said the weak bullion price and lack of overseas buying interest depressed the sector. Spot gold fell below $387 an ounce for the first time in almost two weeks, sending top producer Free State Consolidated Gold Mines down 1.75 rand to 47. Hartebeestfontein Gold Mining dropped 60 cents to 13.75 rand."

Nicky Rose, a strategist with Nomura Research Institute Europe Ltd., called the market's finish a ``creditable result,'' given losses on Wall Street Tuesday, weak global bond markets and some domestic economic data released early Wednesday that hinted at higher interest rates to come. The data showed underlying average earnings rose 3.75% in the 12 months to June, higher than the 3.5% increase expected by economists. Unemployment in July fell 24,100 in July, which was more than double the decline of 11,250 economists had expected.

            "full_text": "Vastopolis -- Cargill Inc., the nation's biggest farm-commodity processor, said profit for the fiscal year ended February 10, 2011 34% to a record $902 million, but warned that high grain prices will probably depress fiscal 2012 results. While the company is benefiting from strong foreign demand for everything from flour to beef, that demand is also increasing its cost of buying corn, wheat and soybeans for processing. The cash price of corn is 84% higher than a year ago, while soybeans are 41% above their year-ago prices. Roberto L. Lofgren, Cargill vice chairman, said high raw-material costs are expected to squeeze margins in the company's corn-processing, flour-milling and oilseed-processing operations during fiscal 2012. Even though U.S. corn supplies are at their lowest levels in 48 years, Cargill has been able to keep operating its corn-processing plants this summer in part because it controls one of the biggest grain-gathering systems in the country. Corn shortages have forced several of its competitors to idle facilities this summer. Cargill has generated record earnings for three consecutive years. The company said sales for fiscal 2011 climbed 10% to $56 billion while cash flow rose to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion. In fiscal 2010, Cargill earned $671 million on sales of $51 billion. Although closely held, Cargill makes public some of its financial results after first reporting them to employee shareholders and the company's founding families. In addition to crops, Cargill trades and processes fruits, meats, eggs, salt, petroleum and fertilizers. It also manufactures steel, and its financial operations span futures brokerage and trading. Separately, Cargill Tuesday disclosed two board changes. Michaele H. Schaffner, the Brookings Institute president whose lengthy government service included a time as Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs as well as two ambassadorial assignments, was named a director. He fills the vacancy created by the retirement of Wm R. Treat. Williemae B. Lamontagne, 42-year-old president of Raycon Oil & Gas Co., was also named to the board, succeeding Burgett Lamontagne Jr."

In keeping with recent history, Toronto again lagged New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 19.60 to 5666.88. Overall on Bay Street, seven of the TSE's 14 stock groups finished higher, with the energy sector posting a 0.69% gain to lead the way. ``The gurus had been telling us to expect lower oil prices'' in anticipation of the resumption of oil exports from Iraq, ``but they were wrong,'' said Solberg Brady of Maison Placements Canada. Now, expectations are for energy prices to remain relatively high on reports that fuel oil inventories, for example, are lower than this time last year, and on the possibility of weaker-than-expected production levels in Europe, Brady said. As a result, ``oil stocks look pretty good,'' he said. But despite gains in energy and several other sectors, a 1.66% drop in the heavily weighted gold group dragged on Toronto's key index. In the group, Barrick Gold fell 1.20 to 37.50. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of gold fell US$1.50 to US$386.40 an ounce."

In other commodity news, Russia is selling its diamonds to dealers, ignoring an informal pact made with De Beers. Soybeans are entering a crucial growing period and require moisture for maximum growth. The Midwest is expected to remain mostly dry through the next few days, which could impede growth of the maturing crops. Wheat fell under heavy commercial selling, while corn rose on strength in the soybean market. November soybeans rose 8 cents to $7.89 a bushel; September wheat dropped 4.25 cents to $4.56 a bushel; September corn gained 4.75 cents to $3.7775 a bushel. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude oil futures prices settled lower Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while the refinery products prices settled mixed. September crude oil futures settled at $22.12 a barrel, down 25 cents, after spending most of the session in negative territory on modest speculative profit taking. The contract reached a session low at $21.95 on reports that Coastal Corp. was seeking to charter a tanker to pick up Iraqi crude at Mina Al-Bakr in early September. However, the contract quickly rebounded and pared the losses, traders said. September heating oil settled at 60.41 cents a gallon, up 0.40 cent, after hitting a fresh lifetime high early in the day at 60.90 cents. Traders pointed to the unexpected draw in distillate inventories in the Energy Department report as a key to early market strength. September gasoline fell 0.60 cent to 62.49 cents a gallon on slightly bearish weekly inventory reports, which kept the contract weak, traders said. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals futures prices settled lower Wednesday, led by silver, as the U.S. dollar strengthened. ``Silver led the way down'' as the precious metals complex worked lower on the day, said Williemae O'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. ``There was no particular news -- no single event'' that led to the sell-off in the silver market, Mr. O'Mccorkle said. But, ``the dollar was quite firm, which didn't help, and the U.S. stock market was showing evidence of a renewed leg up,'' he said. On the Comex division of the Nymex, gold for December delivery fell $1.50 to $391.70 an ounce; September silver lost 4 cents to $5.045 an ounce."

Shares of leisure and media group Granada rose 9 to 866 pence following a report that the company is planning to launch a series of Europe-wide cable-only television channels. Granada also said it will look into making a bid for either Scottish Television or HTV, perhaps in lieu of Yorkshire Television as previously indicated. HTV lost 6 to 353 pence and Scottish TV gained 6 to 718 pence. Shares of Yorkshire dropped 3.0% to 12.35 pounds. Telecommunication company Orange rose 7.5 to 187 pence.

Hinds Driver's chief executive and chairman Ham Jona called the Waldman Hibbert site ``a major new discovery,'' and analysts estimated that gold reserves could total 15 million ounces. At the end of the day, Hinds Driver's volume was a whopping 20.4 million shares, more than 20% of the session's total activity, as the stock soared 4.95 to 11.95. ``Hinds was definitely the highlight of the day,'' said Fredda Mantooth, senior trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc.. Following Bema's lead, Toronto's gold index rose 1.40% to post the day's biggest advance, helping Bay Street significantly outperform New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.10 to 5665.78. The Dow, unlike the TSE 300, lacks a significant weighting in gold stocks. Besides Hinds's gain, a slight rebound in the bullion price also lent support to the gold stocks in Toronto. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the bullion price rose 20 U.S. cents to US$386.60 an ounce. Overall, 10 of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. The energy group, buoyed by continued strength in oil prices, rose 1.37% for the day's second-biggest gain. The forest-products sector also performed well, rising 0.68%."

            "full_text": "-- Strong bids from blue-chip developers at a government land auction here signaled continued confidence in the recovering residential-property market. More than a dozen developers took part in bidding for the two sites up for sale, and the larger lot fetched a price at the high end of market expectations. Outbidding eight other developers, Henderson Land Development Co. bought a 228,195-square-foot residential lot in the New Territories Westside of for 535 million dollars (US$69.2 million). Sino Land Co. picked up a small residential plot in Shek O village near the southeast tip of island for HK$17 million. The well-contested auction and ``wildly bullish'' price for the Tai Po site demonstrated ``positive for sentiment'' in the property market, said Michaele Romo, a property analyst at Lehman Brothers Asia Ltd.. In trading on Wednesday, Henderson's stock price climbed 1.3% to HK$59.25, up 75 cents. Sino Land shares rose 2.8% to HK$2.80, up 7.5 cents. The broader market ended flat: The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed at 11166.77, up 1.10 points. Vested Interests Although the auction results bode favorably for the residential-property market, some property analysts say aggressive bids by Colin and Hong Kong Parkview Group Ltd. for the Tai Po site shouldn't be taken at face value. The two companies each have developments nearby and thus have an interest in boosting the price, analysts say. Colin owns a 283,000-square-foot site across the street from the property it bought at Wednesday's land auction. Combining the two lots as one development, the accommodation value would total HK$2,533 per square foot, according to Heffner Ledford, a property analyst at Merrill Lynch ( Pacific-- Ltd.. Taken alone, the site Colin bought Wednesday would have an accommodation value of HK$2,931 per square foot, he said, adding that the price was ``comfortable'' for Colin. (Accommodation value equals the total land and construction costs divided by the total gross floor area of the development. Colton Ivonne, director and deputy general manager at Henderson, said the company plans to develop the two sites as two phases of one residential development. ``It's not expensive,'' he said. ``Even at this price, it still is cheaper than what paid'' for a nearby site in July 2009. At that time, led a consortium that also included Lai Sun Development Ltd. and China Travel Service (Holdings) Ltd. and paid HK$890 million for a site in at an accommodation value of about HK$4,300 per square foot. Blueprints to Build Henderson plans to build 200 three-story houses on the two adjacent sites, Mr. Ivonne said. The development is scheduled to be completed in 2013. Four bidders vied for the Shek O site. Sino Land plans to build a single house and lease the property as a long-term investment, Chairman Roberto Agee said after the auction. Meanwhile, about 200 Shek O residents held a quiet protest outside the auction hall. Wearing yellow T-shirts that read ``Shek O is my home,'' the protesters claimed that the Shek O site auctioned Wednesday belongs to villagers and not the government. They also expressed concern that future development of the area would alter the nature of the village."

            "full_text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Arequipa Resources Ltd. said ``several major mining companies'' are considering making bids for Arequipa that would compete with Barrick Gold Corp.'s offer of 989 million Canadian dollars ($US719.9 million). Arequipa, a mineral-exploration concern, has been scrambling to find other buyers since Barrick surprised the mining industry with its bid last month. Barrick's bid is unusual because Arequipa is still at an early stage of exploration at its main asset, the Pierina gold deposit in Peru, and the size of the deposit isn't clear. For that reason, Arequipa said it's so far unable to recommend to its shareholders whether they should tender their shares to Barrick's offer. Arequipa didn't name the companies that it said might make another bid. Analysts said few other mining companies would be able to top Barrick's offer because the Toronto-based gold producer's strong financial position allows it to make an all-cash offer, rather than a share exchange that is more common in mining-industry acquisitions. Among the larger gold-mining companies, ``no one has large amounts of cash lying around,'' said Victoria Washington, a gold-fund manager with United Services Advisors Inc. in San Antonio, whose fund includes some Arequipa shares. Arequipa shares closed unchanged at C$28.70 in Toronto Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, above Barrick's offer of C$27 a share. This indicates that some investors are expecting a higher offer, analysts said. Barrick's offer expires May 01, 2011"

            "full_text": "Wheat and soybean futures finished mostly lower Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid conflicting forecasts about the severity and length of a warm spell descending upon the Midwest. Corn ended mixed. Wheat for September delivery rose 1.25 cents to $4.573 a bushel; December corn rose 0.25 cent to $3.493 a bushel; September oats fell 1.25 cent to $1.97 a bushel; and November soybeans fell 5 cents to $7.84 a bushel. Soybeans futures led the retreat, eroding gains that came a day earlier amid forecasts from the National Weather Service for hot, dry weather in key growing regions over the next 10 days. But private forecasters Thursday said the hot weather will be delayed until early next week and likely will be followed by good rainfall toward the end of the week. Soybeans are entering a crucial growing period in which the pods fill out and require moisture for maximum growth. While the crop probably would not be hurt significantly by a lack of rainfall in the next 10 days, investors had been concerned the weather pattern could hold. The new forecasts indicate that temperatures expected to climb as high as 90 degrees will not be hot enough, or last long enough, to stress the crops significantly, said Smith Barney analyst Dalene Deal. ``The cool is going to be lasting just a little bit longer and the rain on the other end is coming just a little bit quicker,'' Mr. Curran said. ``That's taking away a lot of the concern.'' Wheat futures finished mostly lower after soybeans lost ground and amid a lack of export interest. The Agriculture Department's weekly export sales report revealed slumping exports and pointed to little interest on the horizon. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude-oil and petroleum-products closed modestly lower Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, testing support levels in a modest correction of the recent bullish trend. September crude oil ended down 22 cents at $21.90 a barrel, after dropping 25 cents Wednesday. October crude oil lost 18 cents. September crude hit a lifetime high Tuesday at $22.43 and retested the market during Wednesday's overnight session before slipping lower. September unleaded gasoline lost 0.53 cent to settle at 61.96 cents a gallon. September heating oil fell 0.61 cent to 59.80 cents a gallon. Much of the activity in the crude market was technically motivated, with little fresh fundamental news entering the market to influence prices. However, concerns that the emergence of Iraqi crude oil in the coming weeks may pressure prices lower could be forcing bullish positions out of the futures market, traders said. Reports that Coastal Corp. was seeking to charter a crude tanker to pick up Iraqi oil in early September led to some increased selling. Meanwhile, news that a fire at British Petroleum's Lima, Ohio, refinery shut a 36,000 barrel-a-day fluid catalytic cracker there appeared to lend some support to the products, analysts said, though it had little lasting impact. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled mostly firmer on the Comex division of Nymex Thursday. Traders said that a rally in the silver market touched off sympathy buying that pulled up platinum and limited losses in the thin gold market. December gold finished unchanged at $391.70 an ounce. September silver ended up 4.2 cents to $5.087 an ounce. ``The market was quiet until we saw some commodity fund buying of silver, which pushed the market up and lent support to platinum,'' said Bettina Stivers, metal analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. The decline of Nymex silver stocks by 2.1 million ounces late Wednesday provoked some of the buying, Ms. Stivers added. And funds bought mainly ``when they assessed the situation and saw that the market wasn't really crashing'' early Thursday, she said. The World Gold Council earlier Thursday released its second-quarter report, which showed that demand during the quarter was 675 metric tons, down 2% from the same period in 2010. Sharp increases in demand were seen in Mexico, Vietnam and Indonesia."

            "full_text": "Investors in Korean equity funds who have been waiting to haul in the returns this year will have to be patient for a while longer, say many fund managers. So far in 2011, Korea's benchmark composite index has fluctuated wildly. The market is down 6.5% since the start of the year, with its benchmark composite index closing Wednesday at 825.84. Korean equity funds in general have reflected this underperformance, losing an average 6.46% through April 24, 2011 to data trackers Micropal Asia Ltd.. The situation is unlikely to change over the next six months, many fund managers say. Their advice: investors who want to get into Korean equity funds should do so with at least a one-year view. Only over a 12-month period is the Seoul market apt to deliver, they say. `Very Cheap' ``Over 12 months, everybody will agree that Korea is very cheap and also offers a lot of fundamental value,'' says Maud Ledbetter, fund manager at Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd. who runs the Thornton New Tiger Korea Fund. ``But over a six-month period, there's quite a divergent opinion.'' Tiny Chantay, a fund manager at Regent Fund Management Ltd., says that although the Korean market's downside is limited for the rest of the year, so is the upside. She predicts the composite index will end 2011 at between 850 to 950 points. Negative sentiment, fueled by a disappointing macroeconomic picture, is damping the market, managers say. Trade figures have been disappointing this year, with exports slowing while imports have been coming in at the same pace. The current account deficit, targeted at just $12 billion for the year, has already reached $11.9 billion, notes Ms. Chantay. Inventory levels also remain high. Meanwhile, the rate of inflation is above 5%, exceeding the government forecast of 4.5% for the year, says Snapp Yarber, an associate director at Indosuez Asset Management Asia Ltd.. Forecasts Are Lowered As a result, economic growth forecasts for Korea have been lowered. Brokerage firm UBS Securities (East Asia) Ltd., for instance, recently trimmed its 2011 growth prediction for gross domestic product to 7.1% from 7.3%. ``I think we'll be stuck here (at these growth levels) for quite a while -- at least until the end of the year,'' says Michelina Au-Yen, investment manager at HSBC Asset Management Hong Kong Ltd.. But good news -- which will take effect by next year -- is on the way, some managers say. For a start, the market is currently cheap. Friedman Soon Kimberely, a fund manager at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., calculates the market is trading at just 11.5 times projected 2012 earnings. This inexpensive valuation is enhanced by predictions that South Korea's corporate earnings growth will pick up. As the world economic cycle turns, Korean industries that suffered this year, including electronics firms and steel companies, are likely to recover, managers say. Average earnings growth, excluding big blue-chip Samsung Electronics Co., is expected to be 15% in 2011, figures Baring's Mr. Kimberely, hitting 20% in 2012. Rate Hopes With the Korean government promising to further liberalize the economy by raising the foreign-buying ceiling by another two percentage points some time this year, interest rates are also forecast to decline, many fund managers say. That will help many sectors, such as banks, consequently boosting the market. What's more, the beefing up of Korea in the benchmark Morgan Stanley Capital index for Asia likely will nudge the market up by the end of 2011. ``Some upside is likely to come from technical factors, such as the MSCI increase,'' says HSBC's Ms. Au-Yer. ``We may see some foreigners putting new money into the market.'' So fund managers are currently looking selectively for buying opportunities. With exports sluggish, the managers are avoiding Korea's traditional export sectors such as machinery manufacturers. Instead, they prefer companies that derive the majority of their earnings domestically. Korean banks, particularly, are the hot stocks. The gradual deregulation of the economy and the likely decrease in interest rates will reduce the cost of funding and make borrowing cheaper, managers say. This will spur business for banks, boosting earnings growth in that sector to between 30% to 50% a year over the next several years, managers predict. Dennis's Mr. Ledbetter especially favors KorAm Bank. The midsize bank's foreign premium -- the extra percentage foreign buyers have to pay for the stock over the counter -- is modest compared with some of the bigger banks, he notes. Baring's Mr. Kimberely is sizing up Samsung Electronics again. Although Mr. Kimberely slashed his weighting in the stock earlier this year when the gigantic electronics manufacturer was badly hurt by dropping memory-chip prices, continued profit downgrades for the firm means ``it's time to look at the stock from a contrarian point of view,'' he says. In addition, there are signs that semiconductor sales will improve in the next year, with volume growth making up for cheaper prices, he adds."

            "full_text": "SEOUL, South Korea -- Three major South Korean companies, including Samsung Electronics Co. and Hyundai Motor Co., announced dismal first-half results, reflecting the growing woes of the country's export-driven economy. Samsung Electronics, the world's largest producer of memory chips, posted net profit of 453.5 billion won ($555.9 million), down 60% from a year earlier. Revenue, however, increased 23% to 8.714 trillion won. ``It's only going to get worse,'' says Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul. Samsung Electronics' first-half earnings were below Mr. Douglass's estimate of 600 billion won. The reason for the decrease is sharply reduced prices for semiconductors; the business accounted for more than 80% of Samsung Electronics' 2010 net income of 2.64 trillion won. Prices of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chips have fallen to $9 a chip, from nearly $50 in mid-1995. Disappointing results also were turned in by two auto companies. Hyundai Motor, the country's top auto maker, said its first-half net profit dropped 42% from a year earlier to 51.64 billion won, while Kia Motors Corp., the No. 2 producer, posted a net loss of 10.3 billion won, compared with a loss of 12.3 billion won. Lower Prices Predicted Analysts who track Samsung Electronics see the company's troubles continuing. They say it has been receiving prices slightly higher than the going rate for chips on the spot market due to long-term contracts with major customers. But because contract prices follow spot prices, Samsung will be getting lower contract prices in the second half. And since Samsung Electronics' consumer-electronics and telecommunications businesses are only marginally profitable, the company's results could worsen over the next six months, analysts say. Meanwhile, the outlook is mixed for the semiconductor market. Ricki Rule, research director at SBC Warburg in Seoul, believes the market has seen the worst this year, and that chip prices will stabilize. Mr. Rule is sticking to his 2011 net-income estimate of 678 billion won for Samsung Electronics. As for Hyundai Motor, analyst Vincenzo Kimberely of Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul, says the closure of a money-draining auto-assembly plant in Canada early this year was ``the largest factor'' in its profit decline. Mr. Kimberely, who is bearish on Hyundai Motor stock, says the write-off on the company's Canadian investment amounted to 140 billion won during the first half. Hyundai Motor's revenue, however, rose almost 10% to 5.06 trillion won during the same period, mostly because its Tiburon sports car and deluxe Dynasty car -- unveiled in May -- have been well-received by consumers. Hyundai Motor expects full-year sales of around 12 trillion won, up 16% from 10.34 trillion won in 2010. Jone Chrissy Hye, an analyst at Hannuri Salomon Securities in Seoul, estimates Hyundai Motor's full-year net profit at 102 billion won. Still, he is concerned about Hyundai's long-term prospects, given intensified competition in an already-saturated local car market. ``We expect to see (slower) sales growth, but (Hyundai Motor) is still the leader in the Korean market,'' he says. Costly Development Mr. Jone ascribes Kia's poor performance to its prolonged labor disputes and the high cost of developing a new car model. He reckons Kiana spent about $1 billion on the project, compared with an average development cost of $200 million for Hyundai. Even though Kiara's new sports car, Landreth, is so overbooked that buyers must wait three months before taking delivery, Mr. Jone doesn't expect the company's performance to improve significantly this year. For one thing, he says, sales of Kia's Credo sedans have been slower than expected. And Kia's participation in Indonesia's controversial national car project is at risk because of the political turmoil in that country, he adds. The problems at Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor reflect Korea's economic difficulties, particularly its heavy dependence on certain exports. Last year, for example, semiconductors accounted for 18% of total exports. Korea's overall export performance has started to slow as a result of a global slump in semiconductors and weakness in some auto markets abroad. In July, Korean exports fell 3.1% from a year earlier -- the first decline in more than three years -- and caused the merchandise trade deficit to widen to $2.7 billion from $824 billion. The deficit has become a hot political issue ahead of next year's presidential election next year, prompting President Kimberely Yuette Samara last week to dismiss Haskin Wyche Fenwick as minister of finance and economy. The new minister is Han Seung Soo."

            "full_text": "The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index lost 89 to 6284.93 on volume of 1.11 billion shares. Decliners led gainers 312 to 65, with 47 issues ending unchanged. In a surprise move, President Leeanna demanded Wednesday a re-evaluation of the island's policy on China investment, saying too much investment in the mainland will hurt the local economy. Mr. Leeanna's remarks, which were made before the government completes its final review of a US$3 billion investment by Formosa Plastics Group, was widely seen as an attempt at discouraging a huge outflow of capital to China, analysts said. Many investors took to the sidelines to see whether domestic and foreign institutions would withhold investment in Taiwan shares in response to the news, observers said. The plastics sector tumbled 2.6%, the rubber sector fell 1.9%, the financial sector slid 1.8% and the shipping sector dropped 1.3%. Among actively traded issues, Formosa Plastics fell 2.50 New Taiwan dollars to NT$57.50, Nan Ya Plastics dropped NT$1.50 to NT$52.50, President Enterprises lost 70 New Taiwan cents to NT$41.70 and First Commercial Bank fell NT$3 to NT$165."

            "full_text": "Taiwan's president unnerved investors Thursday with a warning about investing in mainland China, sending stocks tumbling 1.4% in Taipei. President Leeanna Teng-Huong called for re-evaluation of government policy on investment in mainland China, saying overemphasis on such investment could weaken Taiwan's competitiveness in the world, officials said Thursday. In a speech at the National Assembly Wednesday, Mr. Leeanna criticized the government's plan to promote Taiwan as an Asia-Pacific regional operation center. ``Many have wrong interpretations on the plan, and government administration has put too much emphasis on seeking direct transportation links with China,'' he said. More than 30,000 Taiwanese companies have invested in mainland China and they are in the process of forming vertically integrated manufacturing networks on the other side of the Taiwan Strait, Mr. Leeanna said. ``The investments are threatening Taiwan's economic growth and industrial development,'' he charged. The unabashed warning spooked equity investors in Taiwan, who fled the market in the wake of Mr. Leeanna's comments. The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index tumbled 89 points, or 1.4%, to end Asian trading at 6284.93 Thursday. Although liberalization has been Taiwan's ultimate goal, the government should be responsible for establishing guidelines to protect the economy, Mr. Leeanna added. ``We can't rule out the possibilities that China will launch further political intimidation or even military attacks'' against Taiwan, he said. Mr. Leeanna demanded that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance and related government agencies develop plans that will stipulate appropriate ratios of overseas investment to domestic investment. He suggested a 20% to 30% ratio as a possible guideline. Meanwhile, he said the government should place a ceiling on investment in China for individual companies -- such as 20% of the value of its domestic investment in the past two years. He also suggested an upper limit to Taiwan's overall investment in China, noting that if capital outflows to Hong Kong and China continue to expand rapidly they will seriously hurt domestic investment. Mr. Leeanna said he opposed proposals to allow Taiwanese banks to open branches in China, saying such a practice could jeopardize the banks' operations if Chinese authorities freeze assets for political reasons. Commercial banks eager to branch out into China should instead be encouraged to form subsidiaries in other countries to help protect the interests of Taiwanese banks, he said. In response to President Leeanna's charges, Formosa Plastics Group Chairman Bland Yung-Chloe said growing investments from Taiwanese companies in mainland China were the inevitable results of a market economy and will have little negative impact on Taiwan. ``Investment in China has become a trend and it's almost impossible for the government to restrict such activities,'' he explained. Mr. Bland added that Formosa Plastics will continue to wait for government approval for its plan to invest 3 billion U.S. dollars to build a thermal power plant in southern China."

            "full_text": "-- In this tycoon-dense town, Leeanna Session Holguin stands out. The richest man in one of the richest cities, Mr. Leeanna made a real-estate fortune through sheer steely courage. When there were street riots in during the 1960s, Mr. Leeanna invested. Whenever the notoriously volatile stock market crashed, he invested. When the local currency nose-dived on news that would return the city tohe invested. Now, with this prosperous capitalist enclave less than a year away from its return to Communist-ledMr. Leeanna is, well, investing. Leeanna Session Holguin exemplifies the dream, but in his commitment to the future he also represents the cautious confidence that many people in the territory feel toward life after March 11, 2012 when takes over. `` still offers the best value,'' says Mr. Leeanna, the 68-year-old chairman of Henderson Land Development Co.. Mr. Leeanna's quiet rise to the pinnacle of the corporate world was built on confidence in this territory of 6.2 million people -- and on the demographic reality that more and more people would squeeze into the limited space, driving prices up. Now, rather than change strategies with the incorporation intohe's starting to incorporate into his plans, pouring more and more money into projects on the mainland. A Critical Barometer For Mr. Leeanna, who Forbes magazine estimates has a fortune valued at $12.7 billion, confidence is the key to success. Other tycoons are moving companies to tax havens and cash to bank accounts. But not Mr. Leeanna. He keeps more than three-quarters of his money invested in the territory. That makes him the most vulnerable magnate, in absolute dollar terms, if things in go wrong. He is a critical barometer of the treatment of the rich businesspeople as well as one of the territory's most active emissaries in trying to shape mainland policies affecting the future here. In a rare interview at his office here, the spry Mr. Leeanna reflects that he wasn't always a fan of the regime. Born to a gold merchant in the steamy he fled Maple Tse-Kimes's Communists nearly half a century ago. He left because the revolutionaries were nationalizing businesses. But he isn't worried anymore. ``Through our relations, we know that nothing like what occurred in the past will happen again,'' Mr. Leeanna says, adding that the leadership has since matured. Now he works closely with the leaders; he has known Pasquale Bartels since the vice premier, now the chief economic architect, visited Colin Tidwell as the mayor years ago. And along with many of the territory's wealthy businesspeople, Mr. Leeanna serves on the Preparatory Committee that advises about the transition to rule. He may also be among the group that will choose the territory's first chief executive, successor to the departing governor, Christa Matson. ``Our thinking is now similar,'' says silk-suited Mr. Leeanna of the cadres. Laced With Caution Yet, for all his commitment, Mr. Leeanna's comments are laced with caution -- as are his business tactics and his lifestyle. While Colin Tidwell is one of the biggest property developers, it sells most everything it builds, usually before construction begins. Henderson Land doesn't even own a flagship building in . Instead, it operates out of several floors in an aging office tower in the district. Mr. Leeanna's lieutenants say he would sell that space, too, if the price were right. That's part of Mr. Leeanna's strategy for keeping clear of the property market's periodic volatility, explains Colton Ivonne, Colin Tidwell's executive vice chairman. Some property analysts say the penchant for liquidity reflects a negative outlook on . It's a ``slash-and-burn strategy,'' says one. But in many ways, Mr. Leeanna is simply the quintessential Hortencia Kile. Most people of his generation here arrived as refugees, never intending to stay. And though Mr. Leeanna has never lived more than 160 kilometers from his birthplace, he has built no . Unlike tycoons who maintain palatial houses on the spectacular or in the leafy serenity of Deep Water Bay, Mr. Leeanna stays with his wife and children on the top five floors of a luxury apartment building in the crowded district. Convenience is a consideration, but so is security, says Mr. Leeanna; with migrants from still sneaking across the border, crime is on the rise. Some Investments Overseas Mr. Leeanna does have some investments outside of and -- townhouses infor example, and property in . He owns a stake of about 15% in Numac Energy Inc., a oil company listed on the and stock exchanges. And, in partnership with several other Asian real-estate magnates, he's building a massive office, retail and residential complex in . But his appetite for foreign adventures is modest. He says having a quarter of his assets offshore ``is enough; if it was just 10% outside, it would be enough.'' Mr. Leeanna has flourished most in . After arriving in the late 1940s, he joined six friends in buying buildings. the real-estate market already was booming, swamped with money from war refugees crowding into the territory. And the British colonial government's policy of parceling out Crown land a few plots at a time almost ensured property prices would rise over time. By the mid-1970s, Mr. Leeanna was a wealthy man, his drab concrete apartment blocks crowding . Demographics, not politics, keep him here. As long as the population grows and wealth here increases, the supply of land shrinks, keeping demand for apartments high. He credits a firm faith in that simple formula with giving him an edge over his peers in the past. And so, while other investors send money abroad, Mr. Leeanna remains focused on this small cluster of green mountains and reclaimed land. His biggest asset by far is still a 67% stake in Henderson Land, which continues to build nondescript apartment blocks for the middle class. Today, that stake has a market value of about US$8 billion. ``For now, if the environment doesn't change,'' says Mr. Leeanna, piling up qualifiers, ``then in the long term, investing in is best.'' --Pui-Wing Tam contributed to this article."

            "full_text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Bema Gold Corp. said its gold discovery in Chile is much bigger than previously known, sending its shares soaring 62%. The mining concern had already outlined a reserve of about two million ounces of gold at its Cerro Casale deposit in northern Chile. Recent drilling below that deposit, however, shows a new, ``major'' gold-and-copper zone, the company said. Based on results from 28 drill holes, Bema Gold Chief Executive Ham Jona said in a conference call to analysts that the new deposit contains at least 500 million metric tons of ore, and could be ``much larger.'' A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds. Most of the ore appears to contain about one gram of gold per metric ton and low grades of copper, with some areas of higher-grade gold, the company said. Douglass Depalma, a mining analyst with Yorkton Securities Inc. in Vancouver, said ``Cerro Casale could be 15 million ounces of gold and as much as four billion pounds of copper,'' a large deposit by world standards. The deposit doesn't contain a high grade of gold, but, ``at large volumes it can be very profitable,'' he said. Bema Gold had already planned to build a mine at the site and is now increasing the size of the project, which could cost between $800 million and $1 billion, a company spokesman said. Hinds Driver was by far the most active stock on both the Toronto and the American stock exchanges Thursday, where a combined 24.8 million shares changed hands. In composite trading Thursday on the American Stock Exchange, the stock soared $3.313 to $8.625. Hinds Driver owns 49% of Cerro Casale, and Arizona Star Resource Corp., a Vancouver affiliate owned 30% by Bema Gold, owns the remaining 51%."

            "full_text": "CHICAGO -- Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade after forecasts for widespread weekend rains caused a stampede out of the market. Corn and soybean futures were the hardest hit by the sell-off, which came after midday weather forecasts predicted about a half-inch of rain will fall in dry growing regions of Illinois over the weekend. The storms were expected to cover as much as 80% of corn and soybean fields, forecasters said. Prices seesawed throughout the day as investors tried to sort through conflicting forecasts. The National Weather Service's 10-day forecast calls for hot, dry weather, while private forecasters each had varying degrees of rain predicted. ``The market was following five different forecasts and moving each and every way trying to figure them out,'' said Williemae Bibbs, research director at Allendale Inc. in Crystal Lake, Ill. ``When all the forecasters said it looks like Illinois will get rain over the weekend, all the bulls were trying to get out the same door.'' Wheat futures fell on the weakness on other markets and on reports that spring wheat harvesting in North Dakota is revealing good yields. Wheat for December delivery fell 5 cents to $4.57 a bushel; December corn fell 6.25 cents to $3.43 a bushel, while the spot September contract fell 8 cents to $3.675 a bushel; December oats fell 5.75 cents to $1.89 a bushel; and November soybeans fell 7.25 cents to $7.7675 a bushel. Meat and livestock futures price bounced back from several consecutive days of losses on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. October live cattle rose 1.43 cents to 71.45 cents a pound; October feeder cattle rose 0.73 cent to 63.50 cents a pound; October live hogs rose 0.70 cent to 55.15 cents a pound; and February frozen pork bellies rose the limit 2 cents to 84 cents a pound. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude oil and other energy futures moved higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange. September crude oil jumped 76 cents to settle at $22.66 a barrel, a new closing contract high. October crude oil jumped 65 cents. The buying in crude oil intensified after the September contract moved decisively above $22 a barrel. September unleaded gasoline climbed 1.42 cents to 63.38 cents a gallon. September heating oil jumped 1.95 cent to 61.63 cents a gallon, surpassing the previous lifetime high of 60.90 cents hit Wednesday. Traders said there wasn't any significant news to lift prices. Instead, they said the advance was a continuation of a rally that began in late July. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled lower on the Comex division of the Nymex, led lower by weakness in platinum and palladium. Gold for December delivery lost 30 cents to $391.40 an ounce, September silver fell 1 cent to $5.077 an ounce, October platinum fell $2.80 to $401.50 an ounce and September palladium lost $2.75 to $125.05 an ounce. Traders attributed the sharp drop in palladium to rumors that General Motors intends to decrease the amount of palladium it uses to make vehicle catalytic converters.

            "full_text": "VANCOUVER -- Arequipa Resources Ltd. accepted a sweetened takeover offer from Barrick Gold Corp. of 30 Canadian dollars (US$21.82) a share, or a total of C$1.10 billion ($800 million). The initial offer for the mineral-exploration concern was C$27 a share, or C$989 million. Arequipa had been scrambling to find another bidder. Just two days ago, it said that ``several major mining companies'' were considering making bids. The bid by Barrick, a Toronto gold company, surprised the industry when it was announced last month because Arequipa is still at an early stage of exploration at its main asset, the Pierina gold deposit in Peru, and the size of the deposit isn't clear. The takeover reflects the increased market values attached to mineral-exploration companies, amid a recent boom in world-wide exploration that has led to some rich mineral discoveries. Under Barrick's revised offer, Arequipa said its shareholders can elect to receive either C$30 in cash or 0.79 of a Barrick common share plus 50 Canadian cents for each Arequipa share held, subject to an overall maximum of 14.4 million Barrick common shares being issued. It said Barrick's revised offer is expected to expire May 09, 2011 said its board is recommending that shareholders accept the sweetened offer and will cooperate with Barrick to complete the transaction. Arequipa said Barrick has signed a lock-up agreement with certain shareholders and the directors of Arequipa, who together hold about 23% of Arequipa's shares, which commits them to tender their shares to Barrick's increased offer. It said its chairman, J. Davina Lucas, is among those who have agreed to tender their shares. It said the lock-up agreement will be terminated in the event of another bid exceeding C$31.50 a share, which Barrick doesn't match, and a break-up fee of C$18 million is payable to Barrick if another bid is successful. The Arequipa board said it has received opinions from its financial advisors, Nesbitt Burns Inc. and Loewen, Ondaatje, McCutcheon Ltd., that the increased offer is fair from a financial point of view to the shareholders of Arequipa."

Taiwan President Leeanna Teng-Huong jolted investors islandwide this week by ordering a review of the government's policy on mainland investment. Taiwan's massive investments there, estimated at US$25 billion, are hurting the island's economy and stunting the growth of local industry, he told the National Assembly in a speech Wednesday that was publicized Thursday. His suggestion: setting up ``guidelines,'' including capping a company's China investment at 20% of its investment in Taiwan. The reports sent the island's stock market into a tailspin, with shares falling 1.4% in active trading. Muted Impact? Some investors fear the government's campaign would cut off lifelines for more than 30,000 Taiwanese companies that have poured money into China over the past decade. In fact, the business impact of the move will be minimal, analysts say. Wily Taiwanese entrepreneurs have always found ways to skirt laws, investing in China through third countries for years before officials formally ``allowed'' them to do so. ``It's not going to fly,'' predicts Nickolas Mcconnell, a Taipei-based lawyer who spends about half his time in China. ``Most of these companies will say, `If you don't want me to (invest in China) on the books, I'll do it off the books.' '' In fact, Mr. Leeanna's announcement may be less a policy change than a public display of pique at Beijing. Cross-strait relations have been frozen since Mr. Leeanna visited the U.S. in June 1995; more recently, Chinese officials have spurned Taipei's efforts to re-establish contact, including Mr. Leeanna's high-profile offer in May to visit the mainland. Subtle Rage ``All his announcements to make peace have not received an active response,'' says Yasmin Kai-Ezell, who teaches political science at Taipei's Soochow University. ``So, he is angry.'' Indeed, Mr. Leeanna heatedly reminded his listeners that Beijing hasn't abandoned the option of using military force to retake Taiwan. The island then should focus on attracting foreign multinationals and increasing competitiveness, without relying so much on China, he said. But Taiwan's economy is highly dependent on that of its archrival. Beijing's missile tests and threats directed at the island earlier this year sent Taiwan markets and consumer confidence into freefall; the result was a sluggish economy from which Taiwan has yet to recover. And the government has quietly dropped an early policy encouraging companies to invest in Southeast Asia as Taiwan investment in the mainland continues to soar. In addition, access to the mainland market is a key attraction for many foreign companies setting up shop in Taiwan -- a theme the government itself has often talked up in the past. ``You cannot be a regional center without China,'' says Mr. Mcconnell, the lawyer. ``It is the region.'' Taiwan's own investors, too, have gone all-out into China, thanks largely to linguistic and cultural similarities that smooth business negotiations. ``To pull back from China goes against the trends of nature and the market,'' says Mr. Yasmin. Quiet Before the Storm Publicly, at least, companies are so far lying low in the wake of Mr. Leeanna's comments. ``No one wants to offend the president,'' says a spokeswoman for one company with extensive mainland investments. But bureaucrats could have quite a challenge on their hands if they really try to stop companies from going to China. For example, the Formosa Plastics Group, one of Taiwan's leading conglomerates, is awaiting final approval from Taiwan to invest US$3 billion in power plants on the mainland. It could just as easily invest through its U.S. subsidiaries if the government said no, analysts point out. It's a struggle Beijing should enjoy watching. ``It can sit back and watch the Taiwan government argue with its businessmen,'' says Mr. Yasmin. ``In Chinese, we call it, `Sitting on the mountain and watching the tigers fight.'

            "full_text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange 300-share composite index rose 16.11 to 5089.18, after rising 24.25 Thursday. For the week, the exchange's key index added about 43 points. Advancing issues easily outpaced declines 545 to 335. Trading volume totaled about 75.8 million shares, down from Thursday's 91.7 million shares. Trading value fell to 950.4 million Canadian dollars from C$989.4 million Thursday. But despite Toronto's performance, it lagged New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 23.67 to 5689.45. ``From a technical standpoint, if we break through 5100, I think we have a shot at our all-time (closing) high'' of 5246.40 set February 10, 2011 Katheryn Albertson, a technical analyst at MMS International. Ms. Albertson attributed Bay Street's gain to the recent rally in the Canadian bond markets. It signals that further reductions in interest rates could lie ahead, which would add a another boost to the Canadian economy and to corporate profits, she says. Given this scenario, it isn't surprising that the banking sector performed reasonably well, rising 0.29%. Bank stocks traditionally move in concert with the bond market. In the group, Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.10 to 34.25. A 0.62% jump in the energy sector also contributed to session's overall gain, as oil prices remained buoyant. But the heavily weighted gold sector damped sentiment, falling 0.65% to reflect recent weakness in the underlying bullion price. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the gold price slipped 30 cents to US$386.30 an ounce. Overall, 12 of the exchange's 14 stock groups rose, with transportation group leading the way with a 1.59% advance."

In addition, Mr. Mcconnell predicted that companies listed on the OTC market would rise to 300 by the year 2015, compared with 66 companies currently. Mr. Mcconnell asked the OTC Securities Exchange to establish a ``risk fund'' before the practice of margin trading. The risk fund can provide financial support to securities houses when crises emerge due to investors' failure to honor their tradings. Separately, the SEC is considering allowing public-issue companies to trade on the OTC market. In Taiwan, public-issue companies are those that are registered with the SEC, but not trading on the main board or the OTC market. Public-issue companies may ask to upgrade themselves to listed concerns on the main board or OTC Securities Exchange when earnings are improved and their stocks are disseminated to more shareholders. The SEC may allow Taiwan's 900 public-issue concerns to trade on the OTC market if each gets endorsement from two securities houses. Investors may be able to trade shares of a public-issue company over the counter and can place orders only to the two securities companies that give their endorsement to a particular concern."

            "full_text": "TORONTO -- Barrick Gold Corp. raised its offer to acquire Arequipa Resources Ltd. to 1.10 billion Canadian dollars (US$800 million), or C$30 a share, a move that won the support of Arequipa's board and fends off other potential bidders. Last month, Barrick launched a C$989 million, or C$27-a-share, offer to acquire Arequipa, which owns a promising gold deposit in Peru called Pierina. The bid startled the mining industry because neither Barrick nor Arequipa has a clear sense of how much gold is contained at Pierina. By offering a substantial sum for an unproven gold deposit, analysts said Barrick is setting a new tone in the mining industry, which could lead to more companies bidding for other pricey deposits before their full potential is known. Arequipa, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, had been trying to line up other bidders, and said as recently as last Wednesday that ``several major mining companies'' were considering making a competing offer. Now that Barrick has increased its bid, a competing offer is unlikely, especially since Arequipa Chairman J. Davina Lucas and other company insiders have agreed to tender their combined 23% stake in Arequipa under Barrick's new offer, analysts said. That lockup agreement will be canceled if another bid above C$31.50 should arise. Assuming Toronto-based Barrick completes the acquisition, it must drill the Pierina property extensively to determine the size of the deposit, which contains some high-grade gold mineralization. A Barrick spokesman said the company estimates there is at least five million ounces of gold and gold-equivalent silver at Pierina. (Gold equivalent is a way of expressing an amount of non-gold minerals in terms of gold ounces.) But PaineWebber Inc. mining analyst Marcelino Rodgers said that based on Barrick's traditional acquisition standards, the company probably believes Pierina contains at least nine million ounces of gold and gold equivalent. Barrick, North America's largest gold producer, had 36.5 million ounces of proven and probable gold reserves at the start of this year. Unlike most other mining companies, Barrick can afford to overestimate the size of Pierina somewhat, Mr. Rodgers added. ``Barrick can tolerate more risk, given their existing cost structure, their balance sheet,'' and the company's other solid mine projects, he said. ``The potential for finding additional deposits is good'' at Arequipa's properties in Peru, said Daniele Leonel, manager of the Invesco Strategic Gold fund in Denver. Mr. Leonel said he'll tender the fund's Arequipa shares to Barrick's new offer, which expires May 08, 2011 deciding whether to take cash or opt for the stock alternative of 50 Canadian cents in cash and 0.79 of a Barrick share for each share of Arequipa. Arequipa shares climbed C$1.30, or 4.5%, to C$30 on the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday, while Barrick's stock slipped 80 Canadian cents, or 2%, to C$36.70."

            "full_text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- As Taipei talks tough with archrival China, one of the island's biggest conglomerates is lending it much-needed clout -- for now. The Formosa Plastics Group, Taiwan's No. 1 manufacturer and private employer, announced Friday it was suspending plans to build a $3 billion power plant in southern China. The surprise halt to what was to be one of the biggest foreign investments in Chinese history lends a mighty punch to Taiwan President Leeanna Teng-Huong's call last week to rethink Taiwan's massive investments in the mainland. Media reports said another listed giant, President Enterprises Corp., is scrapping plans for a $100 million power plant in central China. But the company's chairman denied this Sunday, saying the company will seek government approval for the project by the end of the year as planned, according to the daily Commercial Times. In suggesting a scaling back of more than $25 billion in Taiwan investments in China, President Leeanna is trying to strengthen his hand for upcoming talks with Beijing, analysts say. The two sides haven't had formal contacts since June 2010, when Mr. Leeanna visited the U.S., but they are expected to negotiate before next July, when Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule and loses its neutral status as a conduit for billions of dollars in cross-straits trade. Taipei ``is trying to strengthen its bargaining position in the run-up to 1997,'' says Jordan Royce, Taiwan country manager for H.G. Asia Securities. ``Until mainland China becomes less antagonistic, the government won't want to see large-scale investment in China.'' Relations between China and Taiwan plunged to their lowest point in years when Mr. Leeanna became the island's first democratically elected leader in March. Beijing, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, suspects Mr. Leeanna is bent on establishing the island as an independent nation. Last week, Mr. Leeanna warned that growing business links between Taiwan and the mainland could leave Taiwan's economy hostage to Beijing. But Taipei has limited leverage in confronting China, observers say. Most businesspeople see the island's economic future as inseparable from China's. So Mr. Leeanna may not be able to deliver on his calls to limit Taiwanese investments on the mainland. That could leave him with even less clout in future negotiations with China. Consider the Formosa Plastics case. In a statement, the petrochemical giant stressed its intention to ``comply with government policy'' in calling off the deal, which had been awaiting final approval from the Taiwan government. It even let a government agency announce the decision on its behalf. But the company added that it would reapply for approval of the deal after Taipei clarifies its China policy. If that is slow in coming, Sumner could simply invest in the mainland through its U.S. subsidiaries, analysts point out. Most companies will likely be even quicker to defy the government's new policy. President Enterprises, currently the mainland's biggest Taiwanese investor, told local media it will push ahead with plans for a $100 million power plant in central China. And the bulk of Taiwan's 30,000 investors in China are small companies; they can easily invest in the mainland through third countries, as they have for years. Their investment plans don't hit the headlines. No one knows that better than Beijing. A report Saturday by Communist Party mouthpiece Xinhua news agency gleefully noted that 2,700 Taiwan enterprises have joined a business association in one province alone. Taiwanese companies in the southern province of Guangdong are rapidly renewing contracts, expanding their businesses and making money, the report added. In Taipei, too, there is increasing resentment that the government is stymieing companies' efforts to do business with China. Last week, shipping tycoon Chantal Yung-fa criticized as out-of-date a government policy that forbids direct links with China. Mr. Chantay, chairman of the Evergreen Group shipping and airline conglomerate, is known for his close ties to President Leeanna. The two men ``used to be buddy-buddy,'' notes Jami Garvey, president of fund-management house Fubon Securities Investment Trust Co.. Now, he adds, President Leeanna ``is getting a lot of the business world very angry.''"

China said over the weekend it won't resume bilateral talks with Taiwan, claiming the talks could go on for 10 years without reaching any agreement. The statement triggered a sell-off in issues with investment plans for China, as fund managers and retail investors wonder whether tension with the mainland will ever improve, analysts said. News about Vice President Ligia Chanda's surprise trip to a unspecified European country also sent worried investors, as Taiwan's efforts to seek broader diplomatic ties were expected to spark protests from China, analysts said. Among the actively traded issues, Formosa Plastics fell NT$3.50 to NT$53, and Nan Ya Plastics declined NT$2.20 to NT$48.80. Cathay Life Insurance lost NT$3 to NT$161, while President Enterprises was down NT$2.10 to NT$38.60. Monday was the fourth consecutive session the Taiwan market has declined after President Leeanna Teng-Huong called for a re-evaluation of the government's policy on China. The index has lost a total of 326.42, or 5.1%, in the four sessions through Monday. The plastics sector was the hardest hit with a 4.5% decline, after Formosa Plastics Group suspended a US$3 billion investment plan for China.

Toronto outperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.99 to 5699.44, with some investors sidelined before Tuesday's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee to discuss interest rates. Bay Street investors here, confident that the FOMC meeting will leave interest rates unchanged, focused on the gold and forest products groups, which rose 2.12% and 1.45%, respectively. Among gold stocks, heavy-weight Barrick Gold increased 0.85 to 37.55, as the bullion price on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 1 U.S. dollar to US$387.30 an ounce. The increase befuddled at least some observers. ``Gold in particular sometimes rises and falls for no obvious reason, and today was one of those times,'' said Davina Laurent, senior vice president at Elliot & Page Ltd.. But reasons for interest in the forest products sector were more evident. In that group, pulp producers benefited the most, reflecting their relatively low stock prices, a belief that the underlying commodity price has bottomed, and a drawdown in pulp inventories, Mr. Laurent said. Avenor rose 0.95 to 22.80. Overall, 11 of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. The relatively minor real-estate sector led declining groups, shedding 0.99%."

            "full_text": "If futures traders are right about the future, the value of a barrel of crude oil in the U.S. won't dip below $20 for at least seven months. And if the coming winter is particularly nippy, who knows how high prices might fly? ``The market is defying gravity,'' says Anette Pride, an analyst with ED&F Man International Inc. in New York. There are some bullish fundamentals underpinning the market, most significantly the lean level of distillate products, including home-heating oil, in storage around the country. The Energy Department's inventory report last week revealed an unexpected 400,000-barrel decline in distillate stocks. That leaves a bit more than 104 million barrels in storage, compared with the average for this time of year of 125 million barrels. So a winter of normal temperatures will probably ensure very firm prices, and an icy winter could send them skyward. Already, ``the physical demand for heating oil is very strong,'' says Apolonia Saiz, president of Stone Bond Corp., a consulting firm in Houston, ``and we're not even in heating-oil season yet.'' Inventory levels, of course, have been the talk of the market for the past year. U.S. refiners last fall became disciples of the just-in-time inventory theory, which holds that a company can save money by keeping stocks low and purchasing raw materials just before they are needed in the manufacturing process. That is why working crude storage is about 25 million barrels lower than is typical for late summer. And it is one reason the September crude contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange has been trading so handsomely, settling Friday at a life-of-contract high of $22.66 a barrel. In fact, crude scheduled for delivery through the winter is selling well. The March contract ended the week at $19.75 a barrel, and December settled at $20.93 a barrel. Though the spread of $1.73 between September and December is wide, the price itself is quite nice for producers, considering that Iraqi oil will likely be flowing in significant quantities by then for the first time in six years. But the once-bearish specter of Iraq isn't causing much excitement these days. ``Iraq was a good excuse for procrastinators to put off buying, but it's just not an issue any more,'' says Elane Hayward, a trader at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Washington. ``That story went on for so long that if you were on a desert island getting your news by bottle, you knew about it. The market has had more than enough time to get ready for it.'' After months of negotiations, preceded by months of speculation, Iraq agreed in May to the terms of a deal offered by the United Nations that will permit it to export as much as $1 billion of oil every 90 days in order to pay war reparations and buy humanitarian goods and services. The U.N. is now probably less than a month away from declaring the accord ready to be executed, which means Iraq will be back in the exporting business just about a year after the rumors about its return started circulating. ``We've been discounting Baghdad for so long, I'm tired of hearing about it,'' says one New York trader. The addition to global supplies once Iraqi exports begin will be between 700,000 and 800,000 barrels daily, a fraction of the more than 70 million barrels consumed every day but enough to upset the equilibrium, if not for the luck of timing and, once again, the inventory situation. Global demand for oil in the fourth quarter is expected to be about three million barrels a day higher than in the third quarter because of a seasonal swing. And with stocks low not only in the U.S. but world-wide, the industry figures an inventory buildup in anticipation of the winter heating-oil season will go a long way toward absorbing the Iraqi addition. ``If the (global petroleum system) were balanced right now, Iraq would have a far greater impact,'' says Denny O'Bosch, an energy economist in Irving, Texas. Last year, even before Baghdad looked ready to return to the market, forecasters were predicting doom for oil prices this summer and fall. Fears that supply would far exceed demand had some analysts saying that 2011 would be 1986 all over again, a reference to the colossal price crash that stunned the industry. Non-OPEC supplies would be growing too fast, they feared, and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries itself would be pumping too much for demand to keep up. Instead, oil prices have been strong, contributing to blockbuster earnings for the major oil companies. Demand is so healthy that when world output rose by 500,000 barrels a day in July alone, there was hardly a price ripple. The International Energy Agency predicts the consumption-growth rate will be just as sharp in 2012, driven by economic expansion in developing nations. The Paris agency says global oil needs will grow by 1.8 million barrels a day, or 2.5%, to 73.6 million barrels a day next year. Others believe the IEA estimate is low and that demand will swell by at least another 100,000 barrels. ``We don't think crude will go below $20 any time soon,'' says Mr. Saiz of Stone Bond Corp. ``The fundamentals are a lot better even than most people think. Prices are correctly assessing the market.''"

Mr. Kimberely cited the negative factors as downbeat business prospects, high interest rates and excessive supply of new stocks. Samsung Electronics fell 1,200 won to 69,700 won, while Pohang Iron & Steel dropped 500 won to 50,000 won. By industry sectors, land transportation, wood and machinery sectors were the hardest hit. Banks and securities issues were hit hard with their indexes losing more than 1%. Kookmin Bank dropped 200 won to 15,600 won. Construction issues were also lower, affected by the news involving ailing Norris. The day's biggest gainers were pharmaceutical issues on strong projections. Choongwae Pharmaceutical rose 1,400 won to 35,400 won, and Boryong Pharmaceutical rose by its daily permitted maximum of 1,500 won to 26,600 won. Other gainers were small independent issues such as Seondo Electric, which gained 4,400 won -- its maximum permitted increase -- to 78,800 won. Hyundai Paint rose by its daily maximum of 1,800 won to 33,200 won on expectations of better earnings."

            "full_text": "Corn and soybean futures prices retreated Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade after rain swept much of the Midwest over the weekend and alleviated drought fears. Wheat futures rose amid indications the recent slump in export sales is over. If futures traders are right about the future, the value of a barrel of crude oil in the U.S. won't dip below $20 for at least seven months. An unexpected soaking Sunday night in central Illinois brought relief to corn and soybean crops that had not received much moisture since mid-July. The rain couldn't have come at a better time because crops are in their crucial reproductive stages. Soybeans in particular need the moisture to help pods fill out normally. Losses were tempered, however, amid views that crop tours will find production to be smaller than USDA estimates, said analyst Williemae Bibbs at Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage firm in Crystal Lake, Ill.. Wheat for December delivery rose 7.5 cents to $4.645 a bushel; November soybeans fell 5.75 cents to $7.71; December corn dropped 1.75 cents to $3.4125 a bushel; December oats rose 5.75 cents to $1.9475 a bushel. USDA officials last week predicted overall production would climb 18 percent over 2010 production. But the figure is not high enough to ease a supply crunch that caused stocks to fall to 22-year lows this year and led to spot shortages around the country. Wheat futures initially fell in sympathy with corn and soybeans, but prices rebounded 16 cents in volatile trading amid news Egypt had bought 150,000 tons of soft white winter wheat. Jordan, Taiwan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also were said to be seeking 100,000 tons each of U.S. wheat by the end of the month. Weekly export figures released by the Agriculture Department early Monday showed foreign countries bought 25 million bushels of wheat last week -- slightly better than predictions. The move indicates foreign buying could be on the upswing again, said analyst Marty Colgan at commodity firm LFG in Chicago. ENERGY: September crude oil and petroleum products futures prices settled stronger Monday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, ending at new lifetime highs. September crude rose 60 cents to $23.26 a barrel ahead of its expiration Tuesday, after pushing through resistance at $22.90 and $23.00 and attracting fresh technical buying interest. The contract peaked at $23.35 late in the day, a new four-month high on the spot continuous chart. September gasoline settled at 65.27 cents a gallon, up 1.89 cents, after jumping to 65.40 cents. The contract led the early session strength on speculative fund buying after pushing through 63.50, according to market watchers. September heating oil settled at 62.58 cents a gallon, up 0.95 cent, slightly off its late session top at 62.85, also a four-month high on the spot continuous chart. PRECIOUS METALS: Prices of precious metal futures rose on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, riding the coattails of silver, which broke through technical resistance of $5.13-$5.15 an ounce. There was no fundamental news to prompt silver's sudden rise, said Stormy Cassie, a commodities analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago. Gold for December delivery rose $1 to $392.40 an ounce; September silver gained 13.3 cents to $5.21 an ounce."

The All Gold Index eased 4 to 1730, while the All Share Index sagged 6 points to 6521. Volume was average, with shares worth 361 million rand exchanged. A sterling start to the week for industrial shares was undone late in the session by a round of futures arbitraging against underlying stocks and some late overseas selling. The steady rand supplied much of the early interest, but as the South African currency lost ground against the dollar in late afternoon trading investors took profits. At the close of local equity trading, the dollar was quoted at 4.5535 rand, but in after hours dealings, the dollar had forged above the 4.5600 rand barrier, little more than a cent from its all-time high of 4.5725 rand set Friday. The late retreat in the rand dented South Africa's conglomerates, with Gencor falling 20 South African cents to 14.20 rand; Anglo American off 1 rand to 249; and diversified industrial supplier Barlow down 25 cents to 41 rand. Computer group Dimension Data was the session's most actively trade share, up 14 cents to 8.66 rand on volume of nearly 5.5 million shares changed hands. Dimension Data acquired a 45% stake in Australian communications group Com Tech Communications for 200 million rand. Elsewhere, pulp and paper concern Sappi gained 10 cents at 43 rand and Anglo American Coal climbed 3 rand to 325. Precious-metal issues gained no strength from a mildly higher gold price and the stable rand. Spot gold was quoted at $386.75 an ounce late Monday in Europe, up slightly from the $386.45 an ounce quoted in New York late Friday. Among losing shares, Harmony fell 80 cents to 43.20 rand and Western Areas slid 75 cents to 59.25 rand. Driefontein Consolidated bucked the trend adding 1 rand at 58.25."

Markita Burney, head of equities at ANZ Securities, said the market is clearly ``looking for a budget which is going to be supportive of the equities market. It's as simple as that.'' Among the day's strongest market sectors, the transportation subindex climbed 2.4% and the chemical shares subindex surged 3.0%. Broken Hill Proprietary, a steel, mining and energy company, gained 37 Australian cents to A$17.54 and CRA Ltd., a large diversified miner, advanced 42 cents to A$19.37.

Orion Resources, a gold mining concern, was one of the day's most active stocks, with 4.3 million shares changing hands. All shares traded at A$1.80, in line with a cash takeover offer for the company by Sons of Gwalia Ltd.. Shares in Great Southern Mines jumped 10 cents to A$1.20 after the company announced plans to merge with General Gold Resources.

            "full_text": "The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index dropped 9.2 to 3863.7, while the benchmark September futures contract eased to 3879 from its settlement at 3882 late Friday. The FT-SE 250 index of mid-capitalization stocks, meanwhile, rose 1.9 to 4368.3. Most of the drop in the FT-SE 100 was attributed to a handful of large companies paying out dividends. Also damping volume, if not prices, was uncertainty ahead of this week's scheduled meetings of U.S. and German central bank policy makers on Tuesday and Thursday, respectively. Meanwhile, investors remained focused on the recent split of Thorn EMI Group. Shares of EMI Group and Thorn began trading separately early Monday. Some traders said investors were selling Thorn shares to buy EMI, with the latter viewed as a prime takeover target. But market strategists weren't apt to read too much into the first day's trading. ``That's really just the market getting adjusted,'' said Leslie Mallard, investment analyst at NatWest Brokers. Shares of catalogue retailer Argos rose 1.9% to 757 after the group reported a 45% jump in first-half profit. The company said its six-month pretax profit surged to 31.8 million pounds from 21.8 million pounds a year earlier. Zeneca Group rose 0.12 to 14.90 amid more talk that the biotech company was about to be acquired. Monday's rumored centered on a possible bid for Zeneca by Switzerland's Roche Holding, according to traders. Among FT-SE 250 companies, engineering and industrial materials group T&N led the gainers with a 6.4% gain at 140.2 amid reports that the company is seeking new insurance coverage to cap its exposure to asbestos-related litigation payouts. Scottish Power was one of the major shares that fell on dividend payments, slipping 12 to 302. B.A.T Industries fell 2.8% to a 2011 low of 452 after another court case in the U.S. appeared likely to go against the tobacco industry."

            "full_text": "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Taipei delivered another blow to its battered relationship with China by sending its No.2 official on a secretive trip to Europe. Vice President and Premier Ligia Chanda made a surprise detour to Europe on his way back from a trip to the Dominican Republic. The European visit is the latest in a string of surprises Taipei has sprung on Beijing -- and on its own jittery stock market, which fell nearly 3% Monday. China regards trips abroad by Taiwanese officials as covert moves to make the island an independent nation. Ever since Taiwanese President Leeanna Teng-Huong made an unprecedented visit to the U.S. in June 2010, Beijing has stepped up efforts to coerce and cajole countries into isolating Taiwan. In China's latest victory, the African republic of Niger has agreed to cut its ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing, China's state-run media reported Monday. That brings the number of countries that recognize Taiwan down to 30. Standing Firm But Taipei is standing firm in word and deed. In a speech Monday to Taiwanese diplomats, the president insisted that Taiwan must pursue its own foreign policy, regardless of China's objections. ``What ever China fears the most -- that's what we should include in our strategy,'' he said. That follows Mr. Leeanna's calls last week for Taiwanese companies to scale back their massive mainland investments. ``To add up the Lien Chan visit to everything else, cross-strait relations have no way to get better,'' says Luann Ya-Liana, a political-science professor at National Taiwan University. Those worries helped send Taiwan's weighted price index down 181.11 points, or 2.9%, in active trading Monday to end at 6047.51. Among the hardest hit were companies with big ambitions in China, including the Formosa Plastics Group, which last week announced it was suspending plans to build a $3 billion power-plant complex in southern China. Analysts say Taipei's recent provocative moves are meant to enhance its stature in future talks with Beijing, particularly over the question of the cross-strait relationship following Hong Kong's return to China next year. The British colony now serves as a conduit for cross-strait trade and investment. Harsh Words But harsh words on the other side suggest that no rapprochement is at hand. Parish Wilson, vice chairman of the mainland's office that handles relations with Taiwan, was quoted by the official media over the weekend as saying that Mr. Leeanna's recent statements make talks unlikely. Beijing also is considering closing down next year the Hong Kong offices of countries that recognize Taiwan, according to a report in Japan's Reanna Neil. Analysts see more jitters ahead. ``I think the market will keep going down ... until the government has more clarification on its (China) policy,'' says Maybell Leeanna, who works on the sales desk of H.G. Asia Securities in Taipei. So far, government officials have been falling into line behind Mr. Leeanna. Transportation ministry officials over the weekend said businesses operating in China will face the costly routing of ships through ports such as Singapore or the Philippines if no agreement is reached with Beijing to allow continued access to the mainland via Hong Kong. Taiwanese financial authorities, meanwhile, have asked local banks to set up stronger controls over capital flows to China. Such moves are meant less to remake policy than ``to indicate (officials) follow the president's statements,'' says H.G. Asia's Ms. Leeanna. Still, she said, they are rattling investors who had dismissed the president's speech as just talk."

            "full_text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index rose 33.32 to 5150.89, after adding 1.27 Monday. Advancing issues led decliners, 507 to 361. Volume totaled 86.9 million shares valued at 1.25 billion Canadian dollars, up from Monday's total of 71.1 million shares valued at C$1.2 billion. Toronto outperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 21.82 to 5721.26. All 14 of the TSE's stock groups posted increases, with a 1.81% gain in the heavily weighted base-metals sub-index among the leaders. In that group, Alcan Aluminium surged 1 to 43.40 in Toronto and 1 3/8 to 41 1/2 in New York, despite a dip in aluminum prices Monday. Analysts can't explain the move, but note that investors have decided to invest in cyclicals. Indeed, the stocks of several other U.S.-based aluminum producers also performed well. Aluminum of Vastopolis for example, jumped 1 3/8 to 63 1/8 in New York. Jackelyn Moriah, a portfolio manager at Scotia Investment Management, attributed the interest in these and other metal stocks to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged Tuesday. Investors are now looking for U.S. economic growth to continue uninterrupted and for a rebound in the economies in Europe and Japan, Morgan says. In turn, investors expect increased metal demand to boost prices and corporate profits, Mr. Moriah said. But ``they may be wrong,'' he said. Energy stocks, whose fortunes rest on the price expectations for oil and gas, also performed well, up 0.53% on index, on continued signs that oil demand will remain strong heading into the winter, traders said. In the energy group, Imperial Oil rose 1.20 to 61."

            "full_text": "Soybean futures prices settled higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid worries that soybean plants have not developed fast enough to survive a frost this fall. It's too early for reliable weather forecasts for mid-September, but fears of a cold or even normal fall sent prices higher, said Jay Ford, a broker at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. ``We do not need a normal frost. We need a frost that comes two to three weeks later than usual,'' he said. ``And early frost in Indiana, Illinois and Ohio would be devastating.'' A good harvest is imperative because U.S. storage bins are emptier than they have been in 20 years, and foreign demand remains strong. Wheat futures fell because frost will miss fields on Canadian prairies and because USDA figures show this year's harvest is progressing ahead of schedule. Corn prices were pushed lower ahead of the start of the corn harvest in the South. Soybeans for November delivery rose 5.25 cents to $7.7625 a bushel; December wheat fell 4.75 cents to $4.5975 a bushel; December corn fell 3.5 cents to $3.3775 a bushel. ENERGY: September crude-oil futures prices settled lower on their expiration Tuesday at the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange as investors took profits on gains from the previous two sessions. Petroleum products also retreated. September crude settled at $22.86 a barrel, down 40 cents, as market players liquidated long positions taken during the recent prices increases. The contract reached a lifetime high Monday at $23.35, but never threatened that mark during Tuesday's action. ``It was a fairly non-eventful day for the crude,'' one floor trader said. ``We had two huge up days on nothing, then a pretty orderly expiration.'' September gasoline shed 1.26 cents to 64.01 cents a gallon; September heating oil settled at 61.67 cents a gallon, down 0.91 cent, as speculators took profits on the recent bullish movement. PRECIOUS METALS: Gold and silver finished mostly flat Tuesday after posting early losses as the dollar firmed on a smaller-than-expected June trade deficit. The deficit, reported early, fell to $8.11 billion in June, down from a revised May figure of $10.55 billion, mainly due to a sharp drop in imports. The Federal Reserve confirmed market expectations by making no move on interest rates, following the August meeting of its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee. The decision to hold the line on rates indicates that the Fed doesn't have any immediate inflation fears, analysts said. Low inflationary pressures are generally negative for gold, which is traditionally seen as a hedge against inflation. However, the markets have pretty much discounted low inflation, said Williemae O'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in Cornertown, adding that steady interest rates calm fears that investors might want to move out of precious metals and into interest-bearing investments, such as bonds. On the Comex division of the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery rose 50 cents to $392.90 an ounce; September silver finished unchanged at $5.21 per ounce."

The All Gold Index closed largely flat, up 1 at 1731. The composite index slipped 6 points on Monday, while the industrials gained 2 points. In an active and volatile session, stocks worth more than 467 million rand changed hands. Industrial-share support levels were under fire from the opening bell Tuesday, as traders dumped portfolios of stocks with abandon. The collapse of the rand to a fresh low against the dollar in overnight New York trading served to deeply undermine investor sentiment, said traders. The dollar touched a new peak of 4.5865 rand in local after-hours trading Monday, but recovered somewhat, with Reserve Bank intervention, to a late Tuesday level of 4.5665 rand. Heavyweight conglomerate South African Breweries fell 3.00 rand to 115.50 after trading as low as 114.00 rand, while tobacco and industrial holdings concern Rembrandt slumped 1.50 rand to 36.00, a recovery from an intraday low of 35.40. Construction and manufacturing supplier Barlow sank 85 cents to 40.15 rand after announcing its acquisition of Taubmans, Australia's third-largest paint producer, for 135 million rand. Gold shares ended mixed in very light trading, noted by an almost complete absence of foreign interest. Second-tier stocks appeared to benefit the most, with H.J. Joella Gold Mining collecting 25 cents to 4.35 rand and Kinross Mines up 40 cents to 44.00 rand. Heavyweight Kloof Gold Mining sagged 50 cents to 43.80 rand. Spot gold prices were largely static, remaining in a narrow trading range between $387.00 and $387.50 an ounce."

The benchmark September futures contract was trading at 3901.0 late Tuesday, compared with 3879.0 late Monday. Although volume remained light ahead of any news from the U.S. Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meeting ``the onward momentum has started,'' said Timothy Dean, chief U.K. strategist for UBS Research Ltd.. Mr. Dean said institutional investors are beginning to have more faith in the market. ``There may be a growing appreciation in the U.K. that problems in the U.S. in terms of Wall Street have temporarily abated, and U.K. institutions have found themselves fairly long on liquidity,'' he said. The broad M4 money-supply data helped the market rally to its intraday high, because it showed a dramatic slowdown in growth in the year through July. Shares were further aided by the strong performance in the futures contract, traders said. But a cautious opening on Wall Street kept the index from remaining at its intraday high. General retailers, pharmaceutical companies and banks were the market's star performers. Winning first-half results data released Monday by Argos and a shortage of shares among market makers filtered down to help most retailers. Catalog group GUS led advancers, with its shares rising 23 pence to 663. Also advancing were Huss, up 14 pence to 668; Dixons, which gained 11 pence to 535; and Boots, which gained 9 pence to 637.

            "full_text": "Commonwealth Aluminum Corp. said it agreed to acquire CasTech Aluminum Group Inc. for $274.7 million, or $20.50 a share, creating the nation's biggest independent aluminum rolling concern. As part of the agreement, Commonwealth also will assume $54 million in CasTech's debt. CasTech's stock soared 36% Monday on the news, gaining $5.375 a share to close at $20.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. On Friday, the Long Beach, Calif., company's shares increased about 10%. A CasTech spokeswoman said the company doesn't consider Friday's increase dramatic and that the company had not been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission about the stock's activity in advance of the announcement. The SEC declined to comment. Commonwealth's stock also climbed Monday on the news, rising 9.5%, or $1.375 a share, to $15.875 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Analysts said that showed that investors believe Commonwealth is making a sound acquisition. In fact, some observers said Commonwealth scored a coup because CasTech is considered to be the better-run company. ``CasTech is the leading minimill,'' said R. Doyle Eldred, an analyst with Robinson-Humphrey Co. in Atlanta. Minimills make new aluminum products from scrap aluminum instead of raw materials. ``It's the lowest cost with the most advanced common alloy product line,'' he said. Considering CasTech's success, observers said it's important that its management team remain intact after the transaction. Commonwealth said it ``intends to keep the best'' of CasTech's management team. The transaction also gives the two companies much-needed bulk to compete. ``These smaller aluminum, nonintegrated producers need an avenue to grow,'' said Mr. Eldred. ``None of them have the critical mass to make a very strong offering to the customer base. Putting two of them together, any two, makes a great deal of sense.'' Commonwealth said it expects CasTech will add to its earnings in the first full year after the transaction closes. ``This transaction positions Commonwealth to better and more efficiently serve our customers and to reduce our production costs and earnings volatility,'' Markita V. Dunaway, Commonwealth's president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. Commonwealth, Louisville, Ky., had $672 million in sales in 1995; it makes aluminum sheet for the transportation, construction and consumer durables markets. CasTech, which had $400.4 million in sales in the year ended December 11, 2010 aluminum sheet for a host of markets including building products and transportation."

            "full_text": "The All Ordinaries Index rose 21.3 to 2286 on volume of 305 million shares. Advancers led decliners 392 to 233. The September Share Price Index futures contract on the Sydney Futures Exchange closed at 2301. Late Tuesday, the market closed at 2270 in a special trading session that coincided with the announcement of the government's budget. Though the market initially fell because of weakness in the index futures market, Standard & Poor's improved rating of the Australian dollar boosted trading, analysts said. The agency lifted its ratings outlook to ``positive'' from ``stable,'' claiming the revision reflects the substantial fiscal tightening in the government's 2011-97 budget Tuesday. Analysts said the adjustment triggered fresh demand for the local currency, bonds and equities, as overseas investors sought exposure to Australian markets. All industry groups rose, with finance, gold and engineering stocks outperforming the broader market. The banking and finance subindex rose 1.8%. Commonwealth Bank of Australia gained 31 Australian cents to 11.36 Australian dollars after the bank reported a 14% jump in after-tax profit to A$1.11 billion. National Australia Bank climbed 21 cents to A$12.76 and Westpac Banking gained 17 cents to A$6.21. Doherty added 4 cents to A$3.01 after reporting that its net profit was unchanged at A$233.6 million in the fiscal year ended March 05, 2011 gold subindex advanced 1.3%, lifted by a rising bullion price. Mount Leyshon Gold Mines was unchanged at A$3.75, although the Singapore government relinquished an 8.7% stake in the company at A$3.42 a share in an off-market transaction."

            "full_text": "The Industrial Index slumped 58 points to 7592, after reaching an intraday high of 7684. The index is at its lowest level since November 2010. The All Gold Index lost 5 points to 1726, while the All Share Index dropped 24 points down at 6421. More than 515 million rand worth of shares traded hands, with declining shares outpacing advancers 180 to 125. The market continued to be absorbed by fluctuations in the rand and shifting prospects for an interest-rate hike, which in turn fueled futures-related activity. Futures investors often buy an index futures contract and sell physical stocks that make up that index, or vice versa, to take advantage of price differentials in both markets. Blue chip stocks drew the brunt of the sell-off, while second-tier shares ended mixed. Tobacco and industrial holding group Rembrandt fell 60 cents to 35.40 rand, while banking group Nedcor tumbled 1.75 rand to 53.50 rand. The exchange's most heavily-weighted stock, South African Breweries, fell 1.75 to 113.75 rand. Market watchers said the decline would continue as long as the rand remained unstable and speculation of an interest rate increase lingered. Gold shares ended mostly lower as a listless gold price and a stagnant rand failed to spark a revival. One broker said the All Gold Index was trading at more than a 25% discount to such fundamentals as spot gold, the rand price, gold mine cash flows and the life of mine. Using that formula, the All Gold Index should be around 2200, the broker added. Among gold mining shares, Vaal Reefs Exploration & Mining slipped 6.00 rand to 356.00 and producer Free State Consolidated Gold Mines dropped 60 cents to 45.15."

Volume totaled 91.4 million shares valued at 1.22 billion Canadian dollars, up from Tuesday's total of 86.9 million shares valued at C$1.25 billion. Toronto sharply outperformed Cornertown, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 31.44 to 5689.82, under the weight of falling U.S. bond prices and profit-taking in several blue-chip stocks. The surge in Newbridge's stock highlighted the day's trading both on Bay Street and in Cornertown. In Toronto, the hardware technology stock skyrocketed 15.45 to 82, lifting the TSE's industrial products sector by 2.24%. Meanwhile, in the U.S. the stock jumped 11 to 59 3/8. Newbridge's better-than-expected first-quarter results, announced late Tuesday, sparked the buying spree. News of upward revisions in analysts' earnings estimates for the company's current fiscal year, and upgrades in the stock's rating, added fuel to the surge, analysts said. For example, U.S. broker J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. raised its rating on Newbridge to a ``buy'' from ``market performer.'' The base-metals sector rose 1.26% on expectations of higher metal prices, especially for aluminum, analysts say. Alcan Aluminium rose 0.80 to 44.20. Other cyclical groups also performed well, with the forest products sector, for example, up 1.23%, lending further support to the view that investors are increasingly moving into cyclical stocks. ``The market's recent performance would suggest that, but it's at an early stage,'' said Nygaard Klingensmith, portfolio strategist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc."

Overnight, the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting arm left interest rates unchanged, which most local investors expected. Foreign investors mainly bought shares of HSBC Holdings, developer Cheung Kong (Holdings) and its affiliate Hutchison Whampoa. Cheung Kong and Farr, both controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Liana Ka-Korey, are scheduled to report their first-half results Thursday.

            "full_text": "Depressed by Wednesday's poor performance on Wall Street and signs that an expected rate cut in Germany may not be in the offing, stocks fell from a record high to close at the session's low. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-Share Index ended the day down 11.1 to 3872.1 on volume of 605.8 million shares. The benchmark September futures contract was trading at 3878 at the close of trading in London, compared with Tuesday's close at 3896. Speculation that British interest rates will be cut again this year was reinforced with news of a surprise fall in retail sales in July. Shops sold 0.6% fewer goods in the month than in June, according to data from the Office for National Statistics. Economists had expected a modest 0.3% increase in sales in July after warm weather led to a bumper 1.4% increase in June, but none had forecast a fall. The FT-SE 100 touched a new high of 3894.4 early in the day as traders reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision Tuesday not to move interest rates. But global interest-rate concerns rose anew -- this time over an expected cut in German rates -- early Wednesday after a German economic research group released a surprisingly upbeat report on business sentiment in western Germany. The report appeared to diminish the chance for lower interest rates when the German Bundesbank meets at its scheduled policy meeting on Thursday. Khalilah Chisholm, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, downplayed the German data's significance in London, however, adding that there may yet be a German rate cut. In corporate news, regulatory watchdog group Ofgas, formally known as the Office of Gas Supply, introduced a relatively lenient pricing schedule on TransCo., the British Gas transport unit. British Gas shares climbed 6.5 to 204.5 on the news. Elsewhere, Gurrola, the company that owns Britain's rail infrastructure, dropped 7 to 248.5 on profit-taking. One of the market's favorite sectors of late, retail banks, also fell prey to profit takers. Barclays slipped 15 to 916, while National Westminster eased 15 to 674. British Sky Broadcasting climbed 12 to 547, helped by strong full-year results released Tuesday. The satellite broadcaster said its pretax profit for the year ended March 12, 2011 66% to 257.4 million pounds from 155.3 million pounds the year before, in line with analysts' expectations. Shares of power generator engineer Rolls Royce advanced 3.5 to 222 after the group said it was awarded a 60 million pound engine order by United Parcel Service of the U.S. Although not unscathed, mid-capitalization stocks fared better than blue chips. The FT-SE 250 index rose 2.1 to end at 4387.4. Dairy producer Unigate rose 10 to 432 on word that its supplier, Paulk Embree, plans to lower prices. Transport group Mersey Docks fell 11 to 404 the company said its half-year profit fell 17% to 13.9 million pounds from 16.8 million pounds in the first half of 2010."

Johnetta Ogle Winford, a director of BNP Equities Australia Ltd., added that the early weakness probably reflects a dip in the index futures market late Tuesday. The September Share Price Index futures contract, which was at 2274.0, ended at 2284.0 at its regular closing time Tuesday afternoon, 10 minutes after the share market closed. However, in a special late trading session that coincided with the delivery of the government's budget statement, the contract slipped to 2270.0. On the equities market, industry sectors were mixed with the banking and finance subindex up 0.4% and the media subindex down 0.3%. Shares in Commonwealth Bank of Australia were up 10 Australian cents to A$11.15, after the bank reported a 14% rise in profits to $1.11 billion for the fiscal year ended March 12, 2011 installment receipts were 13 cents stronger at A$7.05. Mr. Ogle Winford said the bank's earnings landed near the top end of market expectations.

            "full_text": "HONG KONG -- Kerry Properties Ltd. said net profit more than doubled in the first half, boosted by steady growth in revenue from its rental properties and warehouse business and by property sales in Hong Kong and China. Net profit grew to 319.4 million Hong Kong dollars (US$41.3 million) from HK$156.7 million a year earlier. Operating profit also more than doubled, to HK$408.1 million from HK$197.1 million. Revenue climbed 41% to HK$738.6 million from HK$522.5 million. The company, whose shares were listed on the Hong Kong exchange April 17, 2011 its results for the first time on Tuesday. The figures are the unaudited combined results of formerly separate companies reorganized prior to Kesha's listing, the company said. Chairman Giguere Gillen Mcconnell said the company is confident it will achieve its profit forecast of HK$1 billion for all of 2011. The majority of property sales for this year will be completed in the second half, he said. The property developer raised HK$2.5 billion from its initial public offering and announced on Sunday a HK$3.6 billion, five-year syndicated loan. Chew Pillow Levi, Kesha's chief financial officer, said in an interview that the company plans to use the new funds to refinance existing loans and to fund the company's major property projects. Those projects include the second phase of the development above the Tai Kok Tsui Mass Transit Railway station in Hong Kong, which this month was awarded to a consortium made up of Kerry, Sino Land Co., Bank of China Group and China Overseas Land & Investment Ltd.. Kerry has a 32.5% stake in the project, Sino Land 42.5%, Bank of China 15% and China Overseas 10%. The funds also will help Kerry increase its stake in 110 units in two residential towers, Yoho I and II in the Mid-Levels district of Hong Kong, to 100% from 15%, Mr. Brazil said. The funds also will be used for other projects in Hong Kong and China, he added. Kerry Properties continues to be controlled by Roberto Giguere Hesson Blais, whose Kuok Group holds 75.8% of the property concern. In Hong Kong trading Tuesday, Kerry Properties stock closed at HK$17.60, unchanged from Monday. The stock was initially offered at HK$17.50."

            "full_text": "Economists are cutting their growth forecasts for Singapore, where trouble in the global electronics industry has hit harder than in any other country in Asia except South Korea. Some predict that real gross-domestic-product growth may slow to 6% in 2011 -- a slumming level for Singapore, which has maintained average annual growth of 9% for the past 30 years. And after 10% GDP growth in the first quarter of this year and 7% in the second quarter, predictions of low single-digit or even zero growth in the third and fourth quarters seem alarming. The key to Singapore's economic health in recent years, tying itself to the rapidly expanding global electronics industry, has become a liability, at least in the short term. Other key sectors are weaker as well, but Singapore's heavy dependence on electronics manufacturing, which makes up nearly 15% of the country's gross domestic product, has led most economists to place the blame on falling global demand and sliding prices for products like semiconductor chips, personal computers and PC components. Electronics account for 52% of all Singapore manufacturing output. ``Inventory was built up across the board from the producer to the end user,'' says Bledsoe Hope Huntington, a Merrill Lynch & Co. economist in Singapore. ``It isn't the underlying demand that's the problem, but people's expectations of what it would be.'' Forecasts Are Slashed These factors led to a stunning 6.1% fall in Singapore's nonoil domestic exports in June from a year earlier. The release of the June trade figures April 01, 2011 economists to slash their full-year growth forecasts and the government to issue reassurances that a recession wasn't imminent. The government itself last week lowered its full-year 2011 growth forecast to 7% to 8% from 7.5% to 8.5%. With Singapore's high wage and land costs, ``if there is any cutback in (global electronics) production, we will be the first to be affected,'' Deputy Prime Minister Leeann Leeds Mortimer told union leaders Monday. ``This was what happened in the last recession, in 1985.'' Trade and Industry Minister Johanson Cahill Tiller notes in an interview that the government has long argued that Singapore's economic growth will moderate to a more sustainable rate. ``As the sixth-largest per-capita GDP economy in the world, 7% growth is phenomenal,'' he says. The roots of the economic slowdown were in place well before the June scare, and some observers expect a more sustained and widespread shakeout before the economy levels off. Indicators Point to Slowdown P.K. Nickelson, an economist at UBS Global Research, notes that the government's composite leading indicators just marked their first year-on-year decline since 1986. The indicators, which usually predict conditions three quarters ahead, are ``unambiguously predicting a sharper economic downturn than the consensus recognizes,'' Mr. Nickelson wrote to clients last week. Citing the composite leading index, among other things, J.P. Morgan & Co. last week slashed its full-year Singapore GDP forecast to 6% from 8.3%. ``With most indicators pointing to continued slowdown,'' economist Davida Cavanaugh wrote, growth could drop to 3% in the third quarter. ``A recovery is unlikely to set in before the fourth quarter.'' With some production lines idle, Singapore lost 2,500 manufacturing jobs in the second quarter compared with the previous quarter. The problem for Singapore now is that there is little to push GDP growth higher in the absence of strong electronics-manufacturing growth. Several of the traditional mainstays of the economy -- ship repair and retailing, for example -- are stuck in sustained downturns. Other Sectors' Woes The stock market is in the doldrums, meaning slower growth in the financial-services sector. In the past few months, oil-refining margins have collapsed, a cyclical development but one that is creating a good deal of pain while it lasts. In addition, slower growth and weaker exports around the region have eaten away at the income Singapore derives as a transportation and communications hub. How soon all this will turn around is still a matter of debate. Some economists agree with government forecasts that steadying prices and shrinking inventories around the world will revive electronics production in Singapore by early next year. ``We are concerned,'' says Mr. Johanson, the trade and industry minister. ``But we do not anticipate the (full-year) growth rate to drop significantly below'' the low end of the government's 7% to 8% forecast. A majority of electronics manufacturers remain bearish on the second half of 2011, according to the government's surveys. But most appear to have faith in the combination of Singapore and electronics manufacturing over the long term. Singapore attracted a record 1.24 billion Singapore dollars (US$879.4 million) of investments in electronics manufacturing in the second quarter. H-P Increases Manufacturing Hewlett-Packard Co., for example, last week reported a drop in third-quarter profit amid sharply lower growth in orders for printers and components, among other products. Yet the company, which has been in Singapore for 26 years and employs 8,000 people here, is increasing its manufacturing operations in Singapore. Still, the slowdown raises questions about the extent to which Singapore has hitched its fortunes to a ruthlessly competitive and cost-sensitive industry. Long-term growth prospects for the global electronics industry remain strong, economists say. But to remain competitive, Singapore will have to find ways of staying ahead of its lower-cost neighbors. Even with Singapore's much-vaunted efficiency, costs are rising. And other countries in the region, while still cheaper, are fast catching up in terms of job skills. Several years ago, government officials engineered a major push for companies to shift labor-intensive manufacturing operations to nearby countries such as Malaysia. This year, Malaysia beat out Singapore in a hotly contested bid to attract Vastsoft Corp.'s Asian headquarters. ``On a comparative economic front, Singapore's advantage isn't in manufacturing; it's really in services,'' says Sonia Seabolt Botello, economist at HG Asia. ``We may not be able to keep up as far as the manufacturing is concerned.''"

            "full_text": "The Taiwan Stock Exchange Weighted-Price Index surged 120.34 to 6177.78 on volume of 1.29 billion shares. Advancers led decliners 357 to 25, while the remaining 42 issues were unchanged. The news that China will open its ports to commercial and passenger ships traveling from Taiwan boosted so-called ``China play'' stocks -- companies that have heavy investments in mainland China. President Leeanna Teng-Huong's apparent backtracking from his earlier statements calling for limited Taiwan investment in mainland China also boosted investor confidence, analysts said. The prospects for better China relations boosted the transportation and petrochemical sectors each by 3.6%, and the shipping sector. Yang Ming Marine rose 1.80 New Taiwan dollars to NT$37.80, and Evergreen Marine added NT$2.10 to NT$48.60. Other China-play stocks also benefited, such as Formosa Plastics, which rose NT$2.50 to NT$55.50. Of the actively traded issues, Ever Fortune Industrial added NT$1.60 to NT$41.10, Hung Fu Construction lost 90 New Taiwan cents to NT$41 and China Steel added 50 cents to NT$26.50."

Investors are likely to remain cautious amid concerns over political risks and a slowing economy, fund managers said. That comes despite China's decision to introduce direct shipping across the Taiwan Straits and a denial by President Leeanna Teng-Huong of his call to scale back investments in China. Newspapers reported that President Leeanna clarified Tuesday that his remarks last week to the National Assembly didn't aim at curbing the island's investments in the mainland. ``The latest cross-strait developments may encourage existing foreign funds to buy in the short term,'' said Rolando Claypoole, a fund manager at Agri-am Securities Investment Trust Corp."

            "full_text": "A monthly government survey is expected to show the beginnings of a recovery in the cattle industry, which was staggered earlier this year by low livestock prices and high feeding costs. The biggest losses in a decade forced many small feedlots out of business, and prompted others to empty their pens. Feedlots, which fatten cattle on grain for slaughter, saw their corn costs double this year as strong foreign demand helped shrink U.S. granaries to their lowest levels in 48 years. Some livestock analysts expect the Agriculture Department's April 13, 2011 survey, scheduled for release after the close of trading Friday, to show the number of young cattle placed on feedlots increasing for the first time this year. While the government is expected to report that the feedlot population is significantly smaller than a year earlier, an increase in placements would signal that U.S. corn prices have weakened enough in recent weeks to return the sector to at least slim profitability. Charlette K. Lasalle, senior livestock analyst at Alaron Trading Corp., Chicago, expects the government to report that ranchers placed 14% more young cattle on feedlots in July than they did in July 2010. Because placements plunged during the first half of the year, Mr. Lasalle expects the seven-state survey to put the April 13, 2011 population at just 6.4 million cattle, down 13.3% from April 12, 2010 ``The cattle industry has started to make a turnaround,'' Mr. Lasalle said. The slow migration of cattle to feedlots earlier this year is now shrinking the supply of fattened cattle for meatpackers to slaughter. As a result, the price of Southern Plains cattle has climbed 24% since April, when it hit the lowest point in nearly a decade. In trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, the cattle contract for August delivery climbed 0.375 cents a pound to settle at a high of 69.875 cents a pound. Economists don't see a strong rebound soon in the cattle sector. Much of the livestock that normally would have moved onto feedlots this summer have been kept on pasture longer than usual. These animals will soon be forced by their advancing age to go to market. As a result, analysts don't expect cattle prices to climb much higher than the break-even levels they are at now for many ranchers. ``The strength and the duration of the rebound are big questions,'' said Ciara Florencio, staff economist at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group based in Denver. ``There is the potential for another round of price pressure after Thanksgiving.'' In other agricultural markets Wednesday, reports that the southern Texas corn crop is widely contaminated with aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen, has grain traders on edge. Some grain processors had counted on the cornfields of south Texas, which are among the first harvested in the nation, to tide them over until the much bigger Midwest corn harvest hits full stride in October. The fungus that produces aflatoxin often strikes pockets of the Texas corn crop because aflatoxin flourishes where dry conditions put stress on crops. State officials are worried that this outbreak might be the broadest in years because a persistent drought has caused about $2.1 billion in losses for Texas livestock and crop farmers. Crop analysts expect the corn harvest under way in Texas to generate 162 million bushels, down 25% from last year. Georgeanna Honey, the Texas state chemist, estimates that roughly half of the south Texas corn crop is unfit for human consumption. Corn containing more than 20 parts per billion of aflatoxin is banned from use in food. Texas officials allow cattle feedlot operators to make rations from corn that has contained much higher amounts of aflatoxin after it has been treated with ammonia gas to break down the aflatoxin molecule. Regulators are toughest on milk, which is banned if it contains more than half a part per billion of aflatoxin, because it is mostly consumed by children. Aflatoxinis one of several substances that state inspectors routinely test for in milk. One Texas dairy was recently forced to dump milk because aflatoxin was detected. Texas grain handlers also routinely test for aflatoxin. While Texas isn't a major corn producer, grain traders are paying unusual attention to the aflatoxin outbreak because U.S. corn supplies are so tight. In trading at the Chicago Board of Trade, the corn contract for September delivery rose four cents a bushel to settle at $3.6625 a bushel. In other commodity markets Wednesday: COFFEE: Futures prices rose to a three-week high as U.S. stockpiles remain at their lowest point in a decade. Coffee for September delivery rose 2.55 cents to 125.05 cents a pound on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange. Leading coffee producers in Brazil and Colombia are expected to produce healthy crops for use during the heavy fall and winter roasting period that begins in early October, analysts said. But those supplies, and others coming from Central America, may be held up until early November because heavy rains have delayed maturity of coffee trees. Meanwhile, coffee-exchange warehouses have less than one week of coffee on hand because Brazil's previous crop was severely reduced by frost and drought. The U.S. is the world's second-largest coffee consumer after Germany, requiring as much as 350,000 bags of coffee for roasting during the peak drinking season in fall and winter. The exchange has fewer than 35,000 bags on hand, far less than usual at this time of year. ENERGY: Crude-oil futures fell after an industry report showed that oil stockpiles rose again last week. The American Petroleum Institute said late Tuesday that crude-oil reserves increased by 296,000 barrels. Traders had been expecting a drop in stocks. Oil for October delivery fell 39 cents to $21.72 a barrel."

Though the market rose in the morning session, heavy selling of blue chips by the afternoon eliminated any hopes of a rebound, analysts said. Large blue chips bore the brunt of selling pressure. Korea Mobile Telecom fell 35,000 won to 559,000; and Samsung Electronics lost 2,000 won to 69,000. Some small-capitalization issues, however, survived the heavy selling. Among them were the so-called mining trio, often referred to as black chips. Youngpoong Industrial rose 2,300 won to 47,300; Jernigan added 3,100 won to 54,800; and Daesung Resources climbed 6,500 won to 119,000. Investors are bullish on these companies because resort towns are being developed near their headquarters. So-called mergers-and-acquisitions issues, or those vulnerable to takeovers, also gained. Ildong Pharmaceutical advanced 2,800 won to 51,100."

            "full_text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index rose 15.02 to 5182.10, after rising 16.19 Wednesday. Advancing issues led decliners, 493 to 390. Volume totaled 96.1 million shares valued at 1.28 billion Canadian dollars, up from Wednesday's 91.3 million shares valued at C$1.22 billion. Overall, eight of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. However, Toronto broke from its recent pattern and underperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 43.65 to 5733.47. In general, Bay Street investors took their buying cue from a 25-basis-point cut in the central bank rate to a range between 3.75% and 4.25%, and the subsequent drop in the prime rates charged by major chartered banks. ``Rate cuts tend to be good for all stocks, by making it less expensive for companies to borrow money,'' said Solberg Brady of Maison Placements Canada Inc.. Traditionally, interest-sensitive stocks, such as the banks, are the first to react to lower rates because their dividend yields are measured against bond yields. However, Toronto's bank group posted a relatively modest gain of 0.31%, reflecting the realization that, in the current interest-rate environment, investors don't see rates dropping much lower from current levels, Brady says. In the banking group, Royal Bank of Canada rose 0.10 to 34.55. Over the longer term, Brady says stocks of biotechnology and other concerns that often rely on raising cash to fuel their operations could be poised to benefit from Thursday's decrease in interest rates. The TSE's heavily weighted gold group led advancing sectors, rising 1.12%, as Placer Dome rose 0.35 to 34.10. On the Mercantile Exchange, the gold price rose 90 U.S. cents to US$423 an ounce."

Trading was volatile throughout most of the day; investors were bearish over the Dow Jones Industrial Average's overnight drop but bullish to reports that China plans to cut interest rates Friday or early next week, analysts said. The news that China would cut rates bolstered so-called China-play stocks, or companies with heavy investment in the mainland. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index jumped 2.8%. Guangdong Investment rose 5 cents to HK$5.70. Hutchison Whampoa rose 30 Hong Kong cents to HK$49.30, and Wynne Hudgens added 75 cents to HK$57.50. Both companies are due to report their first-half earnings soon. Among key subindexes, the utilities notched a decline of 0.03%, though they rose to nearly Wednesday's closing level late in the trading day. Properties surged ahead by 0.9%. The commercials and industrials subindex gained 0.2%. The financials subindex rose 0.2%. Participants said the late burst of blue-chip buying was focused in the banking sector, where Hang Seng Bank Ltd. shares climbed 50 cents to HK$81.50 and Bank of East Asia rose from its intraday low of HK$28.45 to finish unchanged at HK$28.65. Properties performed strongly all day, continuing an upward run as the territory's blue chip developers ready themselves to release their half-year earnings over the next week or two. Wynne Hudgens was the first, reporting its first-half net profit rose 37% to HK$8.16 billion after the market closed Thursday. Investors have been bullish on property shares for the past two weeks on signs of renewed life in the sector. Property prices have begun to climb, and large developers like Henderson Land Holdings Ltd. have again become active bidders in government land auctions. Henderson shares also rose from their intraday low of HK$61 to finish unchanged at HK$61.50."

            "full_text": "Crude-oil and petroleum-product futures prices settled sharply higher Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, despite dipping at midday after reports that the U.N. is optimistic Iraq's oil-for-food sales could begin within 10 days. October crude oil jumped 58 cents to settle at $22.30 a barrel. November crude climbed 51 cents. A monthly government survey suggests that the cattle industry may be making a comeback after enduring high feed costs earlier this year. Crysta Kowalczyk, a director of the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs, said Thursday that a report triggering the U.N.-Iraq oil sale may be issued within 10 days. He cautioned that all monitors of the oil sale and of the arrival of humanitarian goods in Iraq must be on site before oil can flow, however. There was a ``knee-jerk reaction'' following the news as ``lots of longs got out,'' said Geralyn Bergeron, managing director at ARB Oil in New York. But the market ``popped right back up,'' he added. The market ``doesn't seem to respond to basically bearish news,'' another trader said. ``The bullish mentality kind of feeds itself.'' Other potentially bearish news included Petroleos Mexicanos's announcement Thursday that it planned to reopen all three of its Gulf Coast oil supply terminals. Pemex had suspended oil exports when it closed its Alsup Masters and Ibanez Ontiveros terminals late Tuesday, and its Pajaritos terminal late Wednesday because of the presence of tropical storm Dolly in the area. Among products, September gasoline gained 0.76 cent to 63.88 cents a gallon. September heating oil rose 1.5 cents to 62.4825 cents a gallon. Earlier reports of a fire at Tosco's 215,000-barrel-a-day Bayway refinery near Linden, New Jersey, and unconfirmed reports of an explosion on the Sumed crude pipeline that runs from the Gulf of Suez to Alexandria on the Mediterranean were dismissed as officials at both companies denied that operations were incurring any disruption. In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices rose Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as reports from a crop tour in the Midwest suggested yields may be lower than expected. Wheat futures also gained on the news. Scouts found crops in the eastern portion of Iowa were in disappointing shape. That worried traders who had expected crops west of the Mississippi River to be significantly healthier than those in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana. ``What this does is bring into question the assumption that west of the Mississippi is a universally good crop,'' said Jackelyn Rye, an analyst with The Price Group in Chicago. Earlier this week, scouts reported crops in Illinois, Ohio and Indiana were in worse shape that the same time last year. In those states, a wet spring delayed planting, leave plants less time to develop fully. December corn rose .75 cent to $3.385 a bushel; November soybeans added 6.25 cents to $7.8525 a bushel; December wheat rose .75 cent to $4.5625 a bushel. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live hogs rose, recovering from Wednesday's four-week lows on ideas the market was oversold. Frozen pork bellies also rose, while live cattle and feeder cattle futures were mixed. Live October cattle rose .05 cent to 71.17 cents a pound; September feeder cattle fell .15 cent to 63.30 cents a pound; October live hogs rose .30 cent to 53.70 cents a pound; and February frozen pork bellies rose 2 cents to 85.15 cents a pound. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious-metal futures settled stronger Thursday after the German Bundesbank announced early in the day an unexpected cut in its rate for repurchasing securities, traders said. Over the long term, lower interest rates tend to raise prices eventually and stimulate inflation-hedge buying of gold, they said. The ensuing rally in precious metals was driven by ''the German rate cut and the hope that there will be more rate cuts,'' said Bettina Stivers, metals analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery gained 70 cents to $392.50 an ounce; September silver advanced 5 cents to $5.22."

The more difficult call is whether the index will break through this level. ``We'll need support from the Dow (Jones Industrial Average) to do it, but I'm not sure if we'll get it,'' Ms. Albertson said.

The stock's previous 52-week high was 19.75. The gold and banking sectors also performed well, rising 0.47% and 0.53%, respectively. Recent strength in the bullion price generated interest in gold issues, as Franco Nevada Mining Corp. surged 1 to 48."

The fall marked the first drop in the index in six sessions. Analysts said investors were concerned about the interim earnings report by Farr Scarlett. They said the 75% surge in first-half net profit was realized from the spinoff of its U.K.-based telecommunications arm, Orange PLC.. Hutchison fell HK$1.10 to HK$48.20, while its affiliate, developer Cheung Kong Holdings sank 75 Hong Kong cents to HK$56.75. Among the key subindexes, the financials lost 0.1%. HSBC unit Hang Seng Bank fell 25 cents to HK$81.25 while Bank of East Asia fell 30 cents to HK$28.30. HSBC Holdings ended unchanged at its day-high of HK$136. Non-blue chip Wing Hang Bank was the most active stock, after a unit of controlling shareholder Bank of New York sold 12.3 million shares, or 5.0% of issued stock, at HK$28.40. Wing Hang finished flat at its day-low of HK$29.25, after trading as high as HK$29.50. The utilities sank 102.60 to 9725.08.

Sino Land said Friday that it was in talks with bankers to secure part of its rental income, in an effort to raise money. And the commercial and industrial subindex dropped 0.6%. Conglomerate Swire Pacific Class A shares gained 25 cents to HK$68.50 and mainland-backed CITIC Pacific slid 10 cents to HK$34.80. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the Chinese Class H shares gained 1.96 to 843.13. News overnight that China has cut its interest rates helped the sector, analysts said."

            "full_text": "Financial globalization is the result of the liberalizing wave that has hit the world since the late 1970s. Korea's leaders know this, and have determined that the country will not be left behind as financial markets on every continent integrate into one that is global and knows no borders. We've put in place a credible program that is bringing the country up to international standards. In its rapid drive for development in the 1960s and 1970s, the Korean government intervened heavily in the financial sector to induce it to serve the country's industrialization. This policy achieved considerable success in the early stages of economic development, but as the size of the economy grew larger and its structure more complicated, it became increasingly clear that financial resources were not being allocated in the most effective way. Moreover, the nation's banks and other financial institutions were lagging behind both their counterparts abroad and the dynamic companies that had sprung up in the real sector of the economy. Recognizing the need to correct these problems, Korea embarked on a program of financial liberalization in the 1980s. However, the measures taken then were piecemeal and lacked overall vision. Macroeconomic instability and the fragility of financial institutions were also obstacles to financial liberalization. It's really been only in this decade, especially after the current administration took office in February 1993, that a concerted drive for financial reform began. In June 1993, a comprehensive program of financial liberalization was unveiled, covering foreign-exchange and capital-account liberalization, and interest-rate deregulation. Progress has been rapid. Interest-rate deregulation is now almost complete. Apart from rates on demand deposits, which make up only one-fifth of all deposits, deposit and lending rates have been deregulated. The stock market has been opened to foreign investors by successive increments and the current 18% ceiling on their holdings per company will shortly be raised to 20%. The bond market is also being opened stage by stage. Korea intends to accelerate the opening of the bond market as the gap between Korean interest rates and those prevailing internationally narrows. In addition, regulations that hampered the development of the foreign-exchange market have been virtually scrapped, and the Korean won's value is determined in the market under what is progressively becoming a freely floating exchange-rate regime. The exchange-rate band right now is set to a floor and ceiling of 2.25% of the previous day's rate. All of these measures effectively demonstrate Korea's will to bring its domestic financial markets in accord with the norms and standards prevailing in international markets. Financial globalization is expected to contribute to the development of the world economy through a more efficient allocation of financial resources. Especially in the case of industrializing countries, including Korea, it is helping to strengthen the competitiveness of the financial industry by giving it fresh impetus. Additionally, companies that have hitherto raised funds relatively expensively in domestic markets will gain improved access to cheaper sources of funds world-wide. However, the difficulties that a country may encounter while getting its system ready for globalization should not be neglected, as the process can increase instability in the system. The increase in cross-border transactions and settlements causes a much greater exposure to systemic risk. Even a failure by a small bank in one country can quickly affect other financial institutions around the world. The expansion of derivatives transactions has also become another factor increasing the potential instability of the international financial system. Although financial globalization provides potential opportunities for individual financial institutions to enhance profitability, there is a flip side: fiercer competition. In particular, institutions in developing countries, including Korea, have to compete head-on with their developed country counterparts, which possess highly sophisticated financial techniques, ample funds, and networks of numerous branches. From the standpoint of the monetary authorities, financial globalization has disturbing implications for the effective conduct of monetary policy. The widening of capital market opening often triggers massive inflows of funds, primarily in the form of short-term capital, which is liable to flood out again at the slightest sign of impending weakness. And the linkages between monetary policy variables--monetary aggregates, interest rates and the exchange rate--grow much closer. Thus, liberalization makes the conduct of an autonomous national monetary policy extremely difficult, and it frequently generates unwarranted exchange rate fluctuations and monetary expansion. In order to maintain macroeconomic stability, which is the prime target of monetary policy in Korea and the precondition for the success of financial reform, the Bank of Korea has been doing its utmost to keep the money supply at an appropriate level. In addition, it is attempting to promote free and fair competition in the financial sector by ensuring that market principles become firmly entrenched. Financial deregulation and globalization require the monetary authority to step up its efforts to maintain the systemic health of the financial industry as well as the sound management of individual institutions. The Bank of Korea is augmenting its prudential supervision, e.g. by introducing real-time monitoring systems, and impressing upon financial institutions the need to maintain capital adequacy and to reinforce their risk-management systems. Domestic financial institutions, for their part, are making efforts to survive and flourish in the new environment created by financial globalization. They are restructuring their organizations to improve managerial efficiency, trimming excess manpower and identifying niches. It should be noted, however, that they still face a number of challenging tasks. Above all, financial institutions need to make active use of advanced and sophisticated risk-management skills to protect the value of their assets from the various risks to which they are exposed. What is more, they ought to strengthen their credit-analysis function to prevent the incidence of bad loans and to enhance the soundness of their assets. In spite of all the difficulties and challenges posed by financial globalization, there is no viable option for Korea but to press ahead with financial reforms and globalization. Globalization is the path that we have adopted by choice as likely to bring the maximum benefits in terms of social and economic welfare. Considering Korea's expected membership of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we intend to maintain the pace at which we move forward along that path. Mr. Leeanna is governor of the Bank of Korea, South Korea's central bank."

            "full_text": "HONG KONG -- The Hang Seng Index will reach 13000 points by the end of this year, says Chrystal Ross, Asian and Emerging Market Strategist at Peregrine Securities International Ltd.. The widely watched index should ``make record highs shortly thereafter,'' Mr. Ross said in a report. The index, which closed Thursday at 11478.77, is already up about 14% this year and is trading on a prospective price-earnings multiple of 12.1, compared with 14.8 for the region, according to Binette. Mr. Ross said the Hong Kong stock market looks increasingly attractive on a six-month basis, especially since fears of an increase in U.S. interest rates have now subsided. Mr. Ross noted two main reasons for taking an overweight position in the territory's stock market: ``The Hong Kong economy has definitely begun to pick up, helped by a recovering property market and the start of a new cycle of credit-easing in China,'' he said. The Peregrine strategist added that the performance of the Hong Kong property market ahead of the 2012 handover of Hong Kong to China will probably hinge on the degree of buying by mainland interests. He predicted the volume of transactions would increase as China eased credit restrictions. ``We have probably seen only 10% to 15% of the mainland buying which is to come,'' the report said. ``It is important to note that Chinese corporate and municipal entities are investing in Hong Kong with Beijing's blessing. This is legitimate money, as opposed to the mainland buying in 1992 and 1993, which comprised primarily illegal hot money seeking to hedge against the risk of a depreciating (yuan).'' Binette said it expects the index to break through the key technical level of 11400 points, and that it favors banking, property and ``red-chip'' issues. Red chips are shares of Hong Kong-registered, China-backed companies that report their results in Hong Kong dollars."

            "full_text": "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's trade deficit in July soared to $2.74 billion in July from $824 million a year ago, because of sluggish export of semiconductors, steel and petrochemicals, an official report said Friday. The Trade, Industry and Energy Ministry said exports fell 3.6% from a year ago to $10.11 billion last month, the first decline since January 1993 when exports slipped 2.2%. Imports climbed 14% to $12.85 billion, according to the ministry. Early this month, the ministry had disclosed a tentative report, showing the country's trade shortfall of $2.70 billion last month. Dropping prices of semiconductors were the main culprit of the country's worsening trade account, according to the ministry. For example, the price of a 16-megabit dynamic random access memory chip fell 72% from a year ago to $14 last month. Ministry officials said they were worried that the country may only export $18 billion of computer chips this year, compared with its earlier goal of $30.7 billion. The sharp drop is based on forecast that the DRAM chip price could fall as low as $10 at the end of the year, according to the officials. As a result of last month's trade deficit, the country's January-July trade shortfall rose to $10.39 billion from $7.8 billion last year, according to the ministry. They said the country's trade deficit may rise to a record $18 billion this year, from $10.6 billion in 2010."

All sectors were targeted by local and foreign buyers, with the Industrial Index gaining 78 points to 7733, and the All Gold Index putting on 43 points, or 2.5%, to 1740. Brokers said the market received a healthy boost from a stronger rand, lower bond yields and a stable gold price. South African Federico made one of the biggest comebacks after several days of losses in the industrial sector, surging ahead 5 rand to close at 122.50. Bank stocks, another sector largely out of favor in recent weeks, showed improvement Friday, with Nedcor gaining 3 rand, or 5.5%, to 58. Amalgamated Banks of South Africa rose 20 cents to 20.40 rand, and First National Bank put on 1 rand to 27.50. Standard Bank Investment rounded out a positive day for the banking sector, climbing 7.50 rand to 170, a gain of 4.6%. Market leaders Anglo American and De Beers Consolidated Mines enjoyed solid gains, with Anglo jumping 7.25 rand to 255.75 rand while De Beers rose 3 rand to 131.75. Fears of an imminent hike in official interest rates have eased, thanks to signs of recovery in the rand and falling yields at a weekly Reserve Bank Treasury bill auction. However, it was the Treasury bill tender that induced a collective sigh of relief from many in South Africa's financial markets. Interest rate anxiety has been a major factor plaguing sentiment in the equity market the past two weeks, with renewed softness in the rand and extremely tight money market conditions heightening anticipation that the central bank would be forced to act. Friday's solid rally could prove to be a turning point, traders said, and could anchor further gains by the broader market next week."

            "full_text": "Soybean and corn futures prices lost ground Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for improved crop conditions, with warm, rainy weather expected in much of the Midwest. Wheat futures rose, while oat prices eased. Soybean planting was delayed this year by a wet spring, so crops had less time to develop fully. Lower-than-average moisture after the crops were planted contributed to the crop's poor yield. So hot, rainy weather forecast through Labor Day could be very beneficial. Wheat for December delivery rose 1.25 cents to $4.575 a bushel; December corn fell 0.50 cent to $3.38 a bushel; December oats fell 0.50 cent to $1.91 a bushel; and November soybeans fell 2.75 cents to $7.825 a bushel. In early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were lower as traders anticipated the Department of Agriculture's cattle-on-feed report, expected later Friday. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude oil and petroleum-products futures prices fell on the New York Mercantile Exchange Friday in choppy trading, with the October crude contract slightly lower. Crude for October delivery slipped 1.6 cents to $22.14 a barrel. September gasoline shed 0.33 cent to 63.60 a gallon. Petroleos Mexicanos' earlier announcement that it hopes to reopen two of its oil supply terminals after reopening one late Thursday was at least partly responsible for the dip, traders said, as the ports' closure had helped boost prices in the previous session. Traders noted that market participants on Thursday had vastly overlooked seemingly bearish news, when a United National official said Iraqi oil-for-food sales may begin within 10 days. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals were narrowly mixed in New York Friday. Silver was lower after selling by the trade, observers noted. Gold for December delivery gained lost 20 cents to $392.30 an ounce. September silver fell 2 cents to $5.200 an ounce. Traders said silver futures have been stalled by long liquidation for most of this week. Traders continue to roll out of September silver into the December contract ahead of the May 12, 2011 notice day for the nearby contract, observers noted."

Surprisingly strong U.S. inflation data propelled global bond markets lower amid renewed fears of rising interest rates. But the jitters were not enough to hold British shares back. The market regrouped from an early retreat, aided by a resilient FT-SE September future contract, to claw back most of the gains made in early dealing. The September futures contract was trading at 3920, compared with Thursday's close at 3904. ``The U.K. really has a mind of its own,'' said Leonel Harrison, a senior dealer with Masters, who characterized recent market perspective as a ``phenomenon.'' Mr. Harrison added that although the market's strength has a lot to do with market makers' need to cover their positions, optimism about the possibility for domestic interest-rate cuts and the future of the ruling Conservative government are playing a big role. Mid-capitalization stocks also posted strong gains with the FT-SE 250 index up 22.3 to end the day at 4424.8 -- its seventeenth consecutive session of gains. Shares of broadcaster British Sky Broadcasting made the most headway, jumping 3.8% to 578 on reports that the group will offer access to the Internet via conventional television in 2012. Building-materials companies with high German exposure, RMC Group and Redland Group, extended gains logged Thursday. RMC added 39 at 11.14 and Redland gained 6 at 456. Office-maintenance and security group Rentokil slid 3.7% to 403.5 on profit-taking and disappointment that the company does not plan to spin off interests acquired through its purchase of BET as it had earlier indicated.

            "full_text": "South Korea's stock market has dropped 20% since it peaked on January 10, 2011 managers and analysts don't expect a turnaround anytime soon, but they do see buying opportunities. Alarmed by a series of negative trade and economic statistics, investors have soured on local stocks. After last year's 9% growth due to robust exports, South Korea is slowing down -- to an estimated 7% growth in gross domestic product this year. The trade deficit reached $10.35 billion in the first seven months of the year, up 32% from the same period last year. Since South Korea is reliant on a few core industries such as semiconductors, which accounted for about 18% of last year's exports, a crisis in any of those sectors automatically means trouble for the economy, analysts say. With prices having plummeted for South Korea's main export item, dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs, most fund managers are pessimistic about the market until at least next year. Another concern is rising interest rates, usually measured by three-year corporate bond yields. Interest rates are now at about 12.6%, the highest since the beginning of the year. Then there are worries about an oversupply of stocks because many companies are committed to listing before the end of the year. Meanwhile, the government has taken steps to boost the market, but fund managers say they will have little, if any, impact on the market's attractiveness. The Ministry of Finance and Economy announced a few such measures on Friday. It said it will increase the daily fluctuation limit of a stock to 8% from the current 6% beginning next month, and allow small companies to issue new shares as long as their per-share dividend averaged more than 300 won (37 U.S. cents) for the past three years, down from the former guideline of 400 won. But analysts say a much more positive factor for the market is the imminent raising of the foreign-ownership limit to 20% from the current 18%, which is expected to take effect by the end of the year. Amid all the pessimism -- indeed, some analysts don't expect the market to pick up until late next year -- some companies still look like buys. While first-half earnings for listed companies fell by 40% compared with last year, according to the Korea Listed Companies Association, several companies posted excellent results. Take Korea Mobile Telecommunications and Kookmin Bank. KMT's first-half profits rose 88%, and Contreras's rose 119%, compared with the same period last year, and both are expected to perform better in the second half. Francisco Jeffery, an investment director at IDS Fund Management in Hong Kong, says KMT, South Korea's leading cellular-phone operator, ``should continue to do well.'' Mr. Jeffery, who manages a regional fund holding KMT stock, says he isn't terribly concerned about increased competition from a second operator, Shinsegi Telecomm, which recently announced that its services will cost 20% less than KMT's. ''(KMT) has a competitive advantage because it has a nationwide network Parker lacks,'' he says. But KMT's share price has been hit hard by Pasquale's move. The stock fell to a recent low of 559,000 won Thursday. On Saturday it closed at 585,000 won. Foreign investors must pay a fat premium for KMT shares on the unofficial over-the-counter market, where foreigners trade stocks whose foreign-ownership limit has been reached. Even though KMT shares now trade on this market at about a 50% to 60% premium over the local share price, regional fund managers say it is still cheap compared with other Asian cellular operators. ''(KMT's) first-half net profits were well above expectations,'' says Michaele Wynell, who manages an Asian emerging-market fund at UBS Asset Management East Asia. ``We predict a great year-end performance for KMT.'' Some analysts, however, caution that as Parker signs up more subscribers, KMT might slash prices and risk hurting its earnings. Parker isn't a threat yet, with about 37,000 subscribers as of mid-August compared with 170,000 subscribers for KMT's comparable digital-phone services. But Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul, says, ``Once KMT starts reducing prices next year, growth rates will fall, and (KMT) will probably post flat earnings by the end of next year.'' Kookmin Bank fans cite its strong presence as the country's leading retail bank. Kimberely Cotten Barbosa, an analyst at KLB Securities, says the government's economic liberalization drive ahead of its bid to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development won't greatly hurt Contreras's business. Citibank is the only foreign retail bank operating in South Korea, and Mr. Kimberely says it will take a while before other foreign banks are able to compete with Contreras's broad network. One of Contreras's drawbacks, says Mr. Kimberely, is that like other local commercial banks, it suffers from stock-investment losses, about 73.8 billion won in total. But the stock is cheap -- it trades at about 6.5 times projected 2011 earnings, compared with the sector average of 13.7 times, according to Mr. Kimberely. Since the earnings report earlier this month, Contreras's share price hasn't risen, but it hasn't slipped much either. It closed at 15,300 won Saturday."

Volume was 268.8 million shares valued at 625 million Australian dollars. Analysts said the market followed the lead of U.S. financial markets from Friday. A weak domestic debt market and profit-taking contributed to push domestic shares lower. Most industry groups lost ground Monday, led by the media shares subindex, which fell 1.2%. Among media stocks, News Corp. fell 9 cents to A$6.61 and John Fairfax Holdings lost 4 cents to A$2.66. Among the day's more notable moves, Comalco slid 38 Australian cents to A$7.10. The aluminum company reported that its after-tax profit fell 46% in the year ended March 12, 2011 performance didn't hurt Capral Aluminum, which rose 6 cents to A$3.92 on heavy volume of nine million shares. Among interest rate-sensitive sectors, the banking and finance subindex fell 0.9% and the insurance subindex fell 0.8%. Among bank stocks, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group shed 5 cents to A$6.70, and National Australia Bank fell 17 cents to A$12.46. Commonwealth Bank of Australia closed 4 cents lower at A$11.44. The stock goes ex-dividend 52 cents Tuesday. While most blue chips lost ground, Martine Brownfield broke ranks by climbing 19 cents to A$8.24. Shares in Caltex Australia slipped 1 cent to A$5.19. The stock shed 10 cents Friday on news its U.S. parent was looking to divest 43 million shares at an estimated $5.04 apiece. A broker close to the transaction said late Monday the sale was likely to be called off because of weak demand. Qantas Airways was one of the most actively traded stocks, falling 2 cents to A$2.06 on volume of nearly 8.6 million shares."

            "full_text": "Former President Ciara Doo-Robles was given a death sentence by the courts on Monday. Another former president, Willy Tae-Underhill, was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in prison. Both were convicted of treason and mutiny. Several prominent executives are also charged with offering or arranging bribes of the former presidents. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 15.24 to 766.89. Volume was 18 million shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers 621 to 224, with 69 stocks unchanged. Fifty-three issues rose to permitted limits while 69 shares fell by their permitted declines. ``The market sentiment turned frosty after former President Ciara was sentenced to death in the morning, as demanded by prosecutors,'' said Buchholz Hee-Stephenie, an analyst at Sunkyong Securities. Issues of Samsung Group were the hardest hit. Samsung Chairman Leeanna Kun-Heidi was given a two-year suspended sentence. He was among a group of businessmen charged with bribery. Samsung Electronics fell by its daily maximum of 3,900 won to 62,000 won. Samsung, the group's trading arm, fell by its permitted maximum of 700 won to 11,900 won. Other large business groups were also lower, but with smaller losses than Samsung's. Insurance issues were the hardest hit, with the subindex losing nearly 5% on rumors that the government would investigate companies involved in the creation of the slush funds for the two former presidents. Analysts said that insurance companies may have been the most active participants in the creation of these slush funds. Samsung Fire & Marine Insurance fell 19,000 won to 402,000 won. LG Insurance dropped by its daily maximum of 3,800 won to 59,600 won. Smaller issues remained strong, as few of them were affected by the court's decision. Daehan Pulp rose by its daily maximum of 4,000 won to 71,900 won on strong business prospects. Drug issues were slightly lower, but some issues were substantially higher because of mergers and acquisitions involving them. Dongshin Pharmaceutical gained 1,100 won to 44,100 won."

            "full_text": "Corn, wheat and soybean futures prices settled higher Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade on reports that Midwestern plants are in bad shape and will only get worse. Based on observations and data from its Midwest crop tour last week, Pro Farmer, a Cedar Falls, Iowa, agricultural consulting firm, said it is estimating 2011 corn production at 8.2 billion bushels and average yield at 112 bushels per acre. It's estimating soybean production at 2.1 billion bushels on average yield is estimated at 33 to 33.5 bushels per acre, well under Agriculture Department projections. The USDA estimated corn and soybean production at 8.695 billion bushels and 2.3 billion bushels, respectively. Corn and soybean yields were estimated at 118.7 bushels per acre and 36.2 bushels per acre, respectively. December corn rose 8.25 cents to $3.4775 a bushel; December wheat gained 6.5 cents to $4.65 a bushel; November soybeans rose 10.75 cents to $7.895 a bushel. In commodity markets: PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled stronger Monday in Cornertown, led by a rally in silver. The latest Commitments of Traders report by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed commodity funds were net short about 800 contracts in the silver futures market. A net short commitment by funds, as shown in that report, typically ''has resulted in a rally'' in futures as funds cover shorts, said Williemae O'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in Cornertown. Silver for September delivery added 6 cents to $5.567 an ounce on the Comex division of the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange; December gold rose $1.30 to $394.50 an ounce. ENERGY: Crude-oil and petroleum-product futures inched lower Monday on the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange in thin trading. Crude oil for October delivery fell 34 cents to $21.62 a barrel. November crude shed 28 cents. There was no major news to account for crude's retreat. But analysts said the market is on the defensive following overbuying last week. Concerns over the impact of tropical hurricanes on U.S. crude production and supplies might have been exaggerated last week, leading to Monday's follow-through from Friday's correction, traders said. The threat from Hurricane Edouard, the Atlantic season's fourth hurricane, isn't fully removed, however, they added. Other observers said crude was pressured by traders' delayed realization that Iraqi oil would soon hit the market. Among products, October gasoline lost 1.32 cent to 60.44 cents a gallon, pushed lower by reports that Tosco Corp. and the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers Union had tentatively agreed to restart the former British Petroleum refinery in Marcus Hook, Pa., next year. The deal would allow for production of about 150,000 barrels a day to resume at the Marcus Hook plant. October heating oil fell 0.97 cent to 61.01 cents a gallon."

            "full_text": "The copper market may be breathing easier about the Sumitomo Corp. trading scandal, but now there's a new worry: a supply surplus. In the past few years, relentless world demand for the multipurpose metal has sopped up every pound of copper that producers could throw at the market. Now, however, as new mines open and others expand, the long-awaited increase in supply appears to be overtaking demand. ``We are now moving into a surplus situation'' that is likely to push copper prices lower, says Williemae Gonzalez, head of research for Rudolf Wolff & Co., a London metals-trading firm owned by Canada's natural-resources giant Noranda Inc.. After a few years of supply shortfalls, world copper output of about 10.5 million metric tons will exceed consumption by as much as 250,000 metric tons this year, he expects. Others expect a smaller surplus, on the order of about 100,000 metric tons. A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds. Either way, it spells growing inventories. Indeed, copper stockpiles have recently turned higher after spending most of this year declining. On the London Metal Exchange, inventories have climbed to 271,675 metric tons, up from 224,100 metric tons in late July. So far, analysts say, the rise hasn't been enough to rattle prices. Copper's cash price closed at 92.1 cents, up 0.95 cent, Friday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Recent Rebound Copper has rebounded from a low of about 83 cents set in late June, after Sumitomo said its copper trader Bower Wyman had lost $1.8 billion from unauthorized trading. That news sparked speculation that Sumitomo had hoarded copper, and could unload it on the market and drive prices back down. Those fears have diminished, but ``there's still an element of concern relating to Sumitomo,'' says Johnetta Stokes, publisher of the Copper Journal, based in Huntington, N.Y. While Mr. Stokes is bearish on copper in the long term because of rising world production,'' things could heat up in the short term,'' he contends. Continued strong demand in such key markets as the U.S. and Asia could soon push prices back up to $1 a pound. However, should inventories continue to climb, ``we could then test the low that was made at the end of June, if not see lower numbers,'' he says. Copper traders have long expected the market to be swamped with new mine output, especially from South America. So far it hasn't happened. But new projects are helping to create a surplus. The big Escondida mine in Chile, for example, produced 410,800 metric tons of copper in the first half of this year, 84% higher than the same period last year, as its owners, led by Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary Co. and Britain's RTZ-CRA Group, completed a major expansion. Denver's Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. and Chile's Codelco produced their first copper at their El Abra mine joint venture in Chile on April 22, 2011 months earlier than first planned. ``We are ramping up smoothly,'' and the mine will be producing 500 million pounds, or more than 226,000 metric tons of copper, annually by early 2012 at a cost of 35 cents a pound, a Cyprus Amax spokesman says. Mines such as these are likely to increase the world copper surplus in 2012, perhaps to as much as 300,000 metric tons, analysts expect. If prices don't weaken soon, they will eventually, most believe, but another plunge probably isn't likely. ``The fundamentals should take prices down a little bit,'' says an official at a North American copper concern. Porfirio Congdon, RTZ-CRA's chief economist, says: ``A surplus of say, 200,000 or 300,000 tons would not be unmanageable in the context of low inventory,'' adding that prices ``will be somewhere in the 80s during the course of 1997.'' Options as Safeguards That view has caused some companies to safeguard against lower copper prices. Cyprus Amax, for example, purchased options to ensure that much of its copper output for the rest of this year realizes at least 90 cents a pound, and secured the same minimum realization for most of El Abra's production next year. By contrast, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. in New Orleans, has taken a more bullish position on copper prices. The company recently sold options that had put a floor price of 90 cents on its copper sales for the next 10 months, under the assumption that the price protection is no longer necessary. If copper prices weaken, low-cost mines like El Abra will eventually displace some high-cost mines, analysts say, helping to keep world supply in check. Gibraltar Mines Ltd., in Williams Lake, British Columbia, last month blamed copper's recent price plunge for its inability to raise funding to develop its Lomas Bayas project in northern Chile. As more copper hits the market, analysts expect futures prices to return to a premium over cash prices, rather than the market's current ``backwardation,'' where futures prices are below cash prices. The copper market has long been in backwardation because there hasn't been much copper available, and so users have been willing to pay a premium for immediate supplies. The cash price of copper on the LME was 90 cents a pound Friday, while 15-month copper stood at 85.5 cents. ``It doesn't look as if demand is going to catch up with this increasing supply'' of copper, says Johnetta Haag, a mining analyst with First Marathon Securities Ltd., Toronto. ``I think the forward price (for 15-month copper) will probably stay in the mid-80s,'' and the cash price could fall ``to 80 cents or below.''"

In Toronto, declining issues edged advancers, 459 to 454. Volume totaled 77.8 million shares valued at 1.1 billion Canadian dollars, up slightly from Friday's total of 76.8 million shares valued at C$995.1 million. Seven of the 14 stock groups fell, with the transportation group dropped most, falling 0.95%. In the group, Laidlaw's B shares fell 0.15 to 13.15. But the pipeline group jumped 1.91%, and the bank sector rose 0.24%. With Canadian bond yields easing Monday, the relatively high dividend yields of both banks and pipelines looked that much more attractive, noted Isaiah Michaele, portfolio manager of ABC funds. Among the pipelines, TransCanada Pipelines rose 0.50 to 22.10, while Bank of Nova Scotia rose 0.20 to 34 to lead the bank sector. Overall, ``I see fundamental strength,'' in the equity market, Mr. Michaele said. And the continued strength of the Canadian dollar in the face of the central bank's low interest-rate policy in Canada underscores this view, he said. The heavily-weighted gold sector played a minor role, edging up 0.19%, even though the New York Mercantile Exchange gold price rose 1.50 U.S. dollars to US$423 an ounce."

            "full_text": "DONGGUAN, China -- Construction king Graham Currie has just completed his largest power plant on time -- and that's a big problem. To the roar of Chinese lion dancers and celebratory fireworks, Mr. Currie on Monday cut the ribbon on his 1,980-megawatt coal-fired plant in southern China, which went into full commercial operation March 11, 2011 vice minister of electric power praised the Hong Kong businessman for finishing China's largest coal-fired power plant in just four years. It should have been a moment of glory for the engineer who became one of Asia's biggest builders of power plants by constructing them faster and cheaper than almost anyone else. Instead, Mr. Currie has seen his profit from the Shajiao C plant drastically slashed because his consortium failed to meet his own December 10, 2009 deadline that would have earned his companies US$400 million in extra profit. Under his contract, he would have collected nearly all the profit on any power sold before the official March 12, 2011 after the deadline China receives most of the profit. Mr. Currie, who manages Consolidated Electric Power Asia Ltd. and its parent, Hopewell Holdings Ltd., was counting on that money to compensate for the low price at which the plant sells electricity. The two companies now get a reduced bonus of ``tens of millions'' of U.S. dollars, says Hopewell director Layne Jankowski, which ``pales in comparison with what we had hoped to achieve.'' Mr. Currie is now locked in tough negotiations with his contractors over who is responsible for most of those delays. News of the project's holdups has hurt CEPA's share price, which has fallen by 28% from its peak a year ago to close at $13.70 Hong Kong dollars (US$1.77) on Friday. Completed after 48 months of breakneck construction, the Shajiao C plant exemplifies Mr. Currie's fast-track building style, which has made him one of Asia's top infrastructure players. The entrepreneur has been able to snap up power contracts in China, Indonesia, the Philippines and elsewhere by promising to sell low-cost electricity. To compensate, Mr. Currie counts on building the plants ahead of schedule and reaping a hefty windfall. But as the snags and setbacks at Shajiao C show, Mr. Currie's confidence in his ability to meet his own crushing deadlines proves to be an Achilles heel when he fails to snare his bonanza for fast construction. Even so, Mr. Currie managed to build the plant faster than any other coal-fired plant of similar size, says M.F. Bart, an official from GEC Alsthom SA, a member of the construction consortium. To save time and money, Mr. Currie, a Princeton-educated civil engineer, employed innovative construction techniques, such as building the walls of the 75-meter-tall plant with quickly poured cement instead of steel. And to make part of the station's foundation, Mr. Currie recycled coal ash from an adjacent power plant. Although, Mr. Currie ``really pushed the envelope,'' says an engineer, problems outside his control threw a wrench into his program. Last year, when the generator's three huge turbines began to spin at speeds of 3,000 revolutions a minute, the blades on one of the rotors hit the side of its casing, says an engineer involved with the project. It took weeks to solve that problem and check the other two rotors for vibrations. If not for that holdup, says Hopewell's Mr. Jankowski, the facility would have started generating electricity by March 11, 2010 GEC Alsthom manufactured the turbines, and Mr. Currie hopes to collect US$100 million or more of his missed early completion bonus from the company. The two sides have been negotiating for several months and aren't expected to reach an agreement anytime soon. The money would help make up for the plant's low electricity price of about 5.6 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour. In contrast, Hong Kong's largest power company sells electricity for about 9.3 U.S. cents a kilowatt-hour, according to Salomon Brothers Hong Kong Ltd.. Even without the turbine problems, Mr. Currie would have failed to meet his ambitious target by three months or more because of the numerous glitches that usually crop up with such a huge project. At one point, snags developed with the conveyor belt that will feed six million tons of coal annually to the plant's furnaces. In an interview last year, Mr. Currie said, ``I feel frustrated I can't help much'' to solve problems with the rotors and conveyor belt because they were outside his area of expertise. As a result of the delays at Shajiao C and other CEPA projects in Indonesia and the Philippines, many analysts have reduced their profit forecasts for CEPA. Eric Savage, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, predicts that CEPA will report a profit of HK$589 million -- including HK$51 million in operating profit from Shajiao C -- for the year ended March 12, 2011 A year ago, Salomon Brothers expected CEPA to report a HK$1.29 billion profit, boosted by HK$463 million in operating profit from Bow C. Mckeehan, CEPA's projects in Indonesia and the Philippines also have been falling behind schedule. In September 2009, Mr. Currie signed an agreement to build two 660-megawatt generators in Central Java. These can't be completed by 2013 as planned because several issues -- including electricity pricing, financing and land use -- haven't been resolved. Construction hasn't started, and Salomon Brothers predicts that the project won't be completed until after 2015. In the Philippines, CEPA completed its Pagbilao project early but couldn't sell electricity ahead of schedule because the Philippine government hadn't built transmission lines. The company's 1,200-megawatt Sual project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2014, at least three months behind the original schedule, says Salomon Brothers. --Staff reporters Ricki Haugen and Jone Arroyo contributed to this article."

Remarks Tuesday by Christa Mcgowan, the Reserve Bank governor, about the need for continued tight monetary policy and the unlikelihood of an imminent hike in official interest rates, served to buttress the sunnier outlook. Equity advances were broad-based and punctuated by the return of institutional buying from offshore and locally. Futures dealers were also seen in the hunt for physical stocks. Among active counters, steelmaker Iscor slumped 4 cents to 2.71 rand on almost 4 million shares traded. Investors drove the stock to a fresh 2011 low of 2.65 rand during the session, unimpressed by the use of exceptional items to boost the company's net profit 9.6% to 853 million rand in the year to March 12, 2011 tobacco group Rembrandt gained 1.15 rand to 36.25 rand and heavily-weighted conglomerate South African Breweries collected 2.75 rand to 124.25 rand. The gold board extended its gains to almost 90 points since last Thursday, with foreigners supplying much of the share interest Tuesday. Spot gold offered support, vigorously clinging to the $389.00 an ounce level, but showed signs of a decline shortly after local trading. Traders also pointed to generally improving prices for other precious metals for the continuing rally. Western Hirt Alvera was among the big winners, rallying 5 rand to 170 rand following good demand for the stock in overnight New York trading. Western Areas Gold Mining added 2 rand to 62 rand and junior issue Buffelsfontein Gold Mining climbed 1.80 rand, or 7.8%, to 25 rand."

Volume totaled 87.5 million shares valued at 1.03 million Canadian dollars, up from Monday's total of 77.7 million shares valued at C$1.1 billion. Toronto underperformed Downtown, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.38 to 5711.27, helped by gains in bonds, analyst said. Overall, 12 of the TSE's 14 stock groups fell, with the 1.64% drop in the pipeline sector representing the steepest decline. In the sector, TransCanada Pipelines fell 0.35 to 21.75, after Monday's gain of 0.50. The group's sell-off resulted from an end to buying pressure created Monday by broker Nesbitt Burns Inc., said Fredda Mantooth, senior trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc.. Nesbitt Burns bought up pipeline stocks Monday in order to create a security based on the pipeline group stocks, as a way of appealing to investors interested in either capital gains or dividends, Mr. Mantooth said. But Tuesday ``that buying pressure was out of the market,'' Mr. Mantooth said. Gold stocks also weighed down the market, with the sector dropping 0.58% following weakness in the underlying gold price. For example, on the Comex division of the Downtown Mercantile Exchange, the bullion price dipped 50 U.S. cents to US$389.30 an ounce. In general, ``we gave back a bit'' of the market's overall uptrend recorded so far this month, Mr. Mantooth said. At the same time, ``I still see a lot of underlying strength'' in the market, as evidenced by the favorable advance-decline ratio among individual stocks, he said. Toronto's conglomerate sub-index led advancing sectors, rising 0.37%, as Canadian Pacific rose 0.15 to 31.35. after losing 6.30 Monday."

            "full_text": "OTTAWA -- Canadian farmers are expected to record big increases in their wheat and barley harvests this year as a result of higher grain prices. Canada's main wheat crop, spring wheat, is expected to increase 27% this year from 2010 to 892.8 million bushels, Statistics Canada, a government agency, said. Spring wheat is seeded in the spring and harvested in the fall. Canada's total wheat production, which also includes winter wheat and durum wheat, is expected to total 1.10 billion bushels, the largest crop since 1992. Farmers, encouraged by higher grain prices, boosted their seeded acreage of wheat by 15% this year, Statistics Canada said. Higher yields are also expected to contribute to the increase in wheat production. Canada's 2011 barley crop is expected to increase by 25% to 746.8 million bushels, a record harvest. Tight world supplies of barley and strong demand for feed grains by livestock farmers fueled an increase in Canada's barley acreage this year. Barley is the country's main feed grain. Canola production is expected to drop by 17% to 235.3 million bushels, as farmers reduced their canola acreage to make way for wheat and barley. Canola is Canada's main oilseed."

The benchmark September futures contract lost four points to 3923.0. In contrast, the FT-SE 250 index of small-capitalization stocks rose 3.5 to end the day at 4428.3. Traders said it was a typical quiet day after a holiday. There was no U.K. economic news Tuesday, and that coupled with four stocks going ex-dividend led to an early decline amid thin trading. Some early corporate news served to stem the drop, but the FT-SE 100 was only in positive territory once, following a nearly 20-point advance by the Dow Jones Industrial Average at its opening. The ex-dividends Tuesday were Asda, British Sky Broadcasting, Gurrola and Reed International. Combined, they accounted for a 1.6-point loss on the index. Shares in Railtrack Group fell 14 pence to 240 pence per share. The dividend of 13.75 pence per share, to be paid in October was offered as an enticement for investors to take part in the initial public offering of Railtrack in May. Along with going ex-dividend Tuesday, supermarket chain Asda Group announced Allena Hassell will take over as chief executive in September and that Chairman Patsy Fell will retire in December. Asda shares declined 4 pence to 115 1/2 pence per share. Shares in Prudential Corp. closed unchanged from Friday at 437 pence per share despite announcing Tuesday the sale of its Mercantile & General subsidiary to Swiss Re for 1.75 billion pounds. Analysts said Prudential has made nearly double the amount it might have collected had it floated the division on the London Stock Exchange as mentioned in June. B.A.T Industries added 10 1/2 pence to 436 1/2 pence per share after a U.S. jury Friday unanimously rejected a smoker's lawsuit against the tobacco industry."

Mr. Leeanna was given a suspended prison term Monday while the chairmen of the Daewoo, Dong-Ah Construction, Deloach and Hanbo Groups were given jail terms. The share prices of those four business groups remained weak Tuesday. But analysts say their weakness was not due to the sentences.

            "full_text": "Department of Agriculture figures released Monday evening showed only a 1 percent improvement in soybeans and no improvement in corn. The results are slightly worse than a year ago. Fears that China's soybean crop is in bad shape also sent prices higher, said broker Mcwilliams Gallman at the Henning & Carey Trading Co. in Chicago. Expanded buying from Beijing would further strain already tight world supply. However, the gains were contained by forecasts for hot weather and normal rainfall in the Midwest through next week. The weather will help develop crops, which are not strong enough to withstand a normal or early frost. Wheat futures fell on word that Canada and Australia -- already top producers -- likely would experience bumper crops. Forecasts for good weather also pressured prices. Soybeans for November delivery rose 6.25 cents to $7.9575 a bushel; December corn gained 1 cent to $3.4875 a bushel; December wheat fell 1 cent to $4.64 a bushel. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude-oil futures settled lower Tuesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, while petroleum products finished mixed in thin trading ahead of the weekly inventory reports. Crude for October delivery settled at $21.56 a barrel, down 6 cents ahead of the inventory report, with forecasts calling for a build in stocks. The market saw some support on news that Iraq had complained to the U.N. that the number of monitors for the oil-for-food sale was too high, raising fears that oil shipments expected to begin around mid-September could be delayed. September gasoline shed 0.41 cent to 61.21 cents a gallon on reports of a large number of cargoes of gasoline headed to the U.S. from South America and Europe. September heating oil rose 0.10 cent to 61.13 cents a gallon. The contract is expected to see continued support given the low level of distillate supplies, according to market watchers. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled lower Tuesday in very light trading ahead of the upcoming Labor Day holiday weekend, analysts said. Richelle Tony, trader with Credit Suisse in New York, said the markets ''were painfully quiet'' given the lack of liquidity ahead of the weekend. Gold for December delivery fell 50 cents to $394 on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. September silver shed 1.5 cents to $5.238 an ounce."

The decline in the index was exacerbated by a 58-Australian cent fall in Commonwealth Bank of Australia shares to A$10.86. CBA, which is one of Australia's four main banks, went ex-dividend 52 cents, largely explaining the price move.

            "full_text": "Is the Texas drought all dried up? In recent weeks, thunderstorms have rumbled across the state with increasing regularity, feeling -- dare anyone say it? -- almost like normal late-summer weather. The welcome rains have invigorated thirsty crops, greened up lawns and taken the edge off the summer's hottest days. And late last week, the offspring of Hurricane Dolly brought downpors to the scorched regions of South and Central Texas. For the first time in a long while, many farmers and other residents are seeing some relief. And for some, it's more than just a respite: They are declaring the worst of the drought over. As evidence, they say rainfall is some regions is keeping pace with annual averages for this time of year. And supporting their conviction: Meteorologists are downgrading forecasts of the drought's duration and severity, and economists are lowering estimates of 2011 crop damage. Before turning off the sprinkler, however, a dry word of caution: The optimists are in the minority. The entire state is still officially drought-stricken, with all regions in some stage of drought, ranging from mild to extreme, according to a National Weather Service index. What's more, most Texas meteorologists remain pessimistic. They say the state is so far behind in rainfall that it's going to take a rainstorm of Old Testament proportions -- or at least several months of above-average rainfall -- to pull the state out of its dry hole. Part of the split opinion can be explained this way: The drought means different things to different people. Georgeanna Quintanilla, meteorologist for the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, distinguishes between the visible and invisible drought. The visible, or agricultural, drought has eased across much of Texas -- that can be seen in the healthier crops, lusher pastures and greener lawns. But the invisible drought -- the one that has drained water tanks and reservoirs and dried out soil deep in the earth -- remains as bad as ever, he says. So many meteorologists, who look at things like deep-soil moisture, consider the drought as bad as ever even as farmers making record crops declare it gone. Still, just the fact that anybody is optimistic is a far cry from a short time ago. ``As far as I'm concerned, it's over,'' says Bret Livingston, a soil expert for the state agricultural extension service in Amarillo. He observes that the Panhandle is running about even with the 14 inches of rain that's normal for the year up to this date -- nearly all of it coming since the end of May. The Panhandle's recent rainfall has been the most dramatic turnaround in the state. In fact, a drought-management conference in the region planned for May 04, 2011 canceled when it was deemed no longer necessary. Masterson Jimmy Billy Andrea knows the exact date the first rains brought relief to his parched pastures in Lipscomb and Hemphill counties: February 03, 2011 he speaks of the drought in the past tense. ``It was deep and long,'' he says. ``But the turnaround was just as dramatic as the drought.'' Jayme Conklin, president of Boatmen's First Canadian Bank in the Panhandle, says ranchers are now enjoying the ``problem'' of finding enough cattle to feed on their green pastures, or someone to harvest their ample fields of hay (currently, there's a six-week waiting period for harvesting because hay balers can't keep up with demand for their services). Similar relief, though not quite as bountiful, has reached much of West and North Central Texas. Mr. Quintanilla, the meteorologist, attended a recent drought meeting in Sherman near the Oklahoma border, and says it's hard to tell it's August in the region. ``This year it's as green as a tropical rain forest up there,'' he says. Some of the numbers do look good for Texas. Projections based on the official drought index used by the National Weather Service -- which measures rainfall, evaporation rates and soil moisture -- improved dramatically all across Texas in just two months. For instance, in May, North Texas was given a 75% likelihood of remaining in a moderate to severe drought for the next three months; Central Texas had a 70% chance. But by July, the probability for the next three months had dropped to 54% for the Northern region, and 57% for Central Texas -- and that was before much of the recent rains began. In another indication that the worst may be over, dire projections of huge drought-related agricultural losses made at the start of summer were softened last week to reflect the rainfall. Agricultural economists at Texas A&M University now expect drought losses for producers to reach $2.1 billion this year, compared with estimates of $2.4 billion originally. Since more than two-thirds of those losses had already occurred when the new figures were calculated, the revision shows the dramatic improvement in the crop outlook for the remainder of the year. Perhaps the biggest sigh of relief comes from the Plains region of West Texas. There, losses are now expected to be only about $179 million, down from the nearly $500 million expected three months ago. Lloyd Urban, director of the Water Resources Center at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, attests that he went on an agricultural tour of the area in mid-August and ``saw some of the best cotton I've ever seen in my life.'' The recent rains, agrees Carlee Andrea, a Texas A&M economist and cotton specialist, ``more or less saved the day'' in West Texas. ``Let's hope this is the beginning of the breaking of the drought.'' So how, amid all these signs, do the more-pessimistic meteorologists and state officials see it? Agricultural bankers point out that even in the now-lush Thomsen, heavy losses from the record dry spell won't be washed away by the rain. Financing will still be tough next year as bankers review farmers' and ranchers' operations that have lost an average 40% of their equity in one year. And some water and agricultural experts caution against feeling too good about the wetting Texas has been getting. In the first place, not everyone has gotten the rain. South and Central Texas continue to suffer mightily. Even where rain has fallen, it isn't enough to make much of a dent in the deep-seated drought. ``Yes, we're still in a severe drought,'' says Treena Wilton, a Texas A&M soil professor and chairman of the state drought committee, who notes that even droughts can have their wet spells. Though the experts concede the recent rains are more in tune with Texas' normal weather for this time of year, they still don't see a major shift in the long-term weather patterns that caused the drought. Based on that, Johnetta Arevalo, the state's official climatologist, says, ``I don't see any clues that the drought is coming to an end.'' The recent rains, adds Mr. Quintanilla, the meteorologist, ``can be viewed only as a respite.'' Even Agricultural Commissioner Rickie Petra, who might be expected to take the sunnier view of the farmers and ranchers, is among those stressing the worst. Instead of highlighting the improved outlook for agriculture, Mr. Petra emphasizes the devastation of the drought. ``Summer rains have given us a reprieve, but certainly not a pardon,'' he says. ``We hope this is the start of a weather pattern change ... But we don't know. I'm going to be very cautious in saying this is the end of the 1990s drought.'' Political motives may lurk behind the officials' responses, some skeptics say: Texas is still trying to gain disaster status for several Texas counties. But Evelynn Browning-Easton blames official pessimism on something else: ego. Ms. Browning-Alter, who produces a weather forecasting newsletter in Sandia Park, N.M., for the Southwest U.S., says some officials and meteorologists may continue to stress the worst-case scenario because they're enjoying the limelight. ``There's a lot of people who have gotten a lot of glory because they've been involved in drought relief,'' she says. Mr. Petra responds that there is no political advantage is stressing the bad, noting that politicians usually benefit more when they can say things are going well. As for disaster declarations, he says those are based on damages that have already occurred, so a change in drought status wouldn't affect those efforts. Mr. Petra says he is pessimistic because he sees too many parallels between this drought and the seven-year drought of the '50s. But Ms. Browning-Alter looked at history and came to another conclusion. She analyzed five years with similar weather conditions and found that in four of those years, rains came by August. And in three of the years, ``the drought was pretty much over by autumn,'' she says. Ms. Browning-Easton was one of the earliest optimists on the Texas drought. In early June she predicted to a meeting of ranchers in Corpus Christia that the drought would begin easing in August as more normal rainfall returned to the state. ``Most people were asking ``Will there be rain?'' '' she recalls. ``So I went there and said, `Yes, there will be rain.' '' There is hope for the months ahead. September and October are traditionally the state's best rainfall months as tropical storm systems from the Gulf butt heads with cold fronts descending from the north. The result is usually many days of widespread, heavy rains -- just the kind needed to break the drought. Whether that happens this year remains to be seen. In the meantime, there's a good chance that the drought picture will continue to be confusing to many. ``That's the funny thing about the drought,'' says Prof. Wilton of Texas A&M. ``You can't say, `Yesterday I was in a drought but today I'm not.' It's kind of hard to say when the end of it is.''"

            "full_text": "Wheat futures prices settled lower Wednesday at the Chicago Board of Trade on concerns about rising supplies as exports lag. Canada this week announced it expected a record-breaking wheat yield. Other countries also expect unusually large harvests, which means they will import less and export more. Their wheat is expected to be cheaper than U.S. grain. Traders shrugged off the morning announcement that Egypt had bought 100,000 tons of soft red winter wheat; the news already had been factored into the market, said Mikki Yuette at Pacific Futures Trading Co. in Seattle. Prices also fell on forecasts that good weather should allow the harvest to finish ahead of schedule. The weather reports also pushed corn and soybean futures lower as Midwestern crops are expected to thrive over the hot Labor Day weekend. Soybean prices were also pressured by profit-taking, as prices have dropped about 80 cents a bushel in the past three weeks. Wheat for December delivery fell 9 cents to $4.55 a bushel; December corn dropped 6 cents to $3.4275 a bushel; November soybeans lost 7 cents to $7.8875 a bushel. In other commodity markets: ENERGY: Crude-oil futures prices settled higher Wednesday on the Downtown Mercantile Exchange, boosted by a jump in refinery-product prices. October crude oil rose 15 cents to $21.71 after retreating initially on larger-than-expected builds in inventories shown in the weekly reports, though the October contract quickly rebounded and followed the strength in products' prices. September gasoline was the strongest member of the complex, settling at 62.33 cents a gallon, up 1.12 cents. Traders said much of the strength was short covering from recent bearish movement, as well as rolling of positions ahead of the spot products' expiration on Friday. September heating oil ended at 62.04 cents, up 0.91 cent. The contract found some buying interest on the slightly bullish weekly inventory figures. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals lost ground Wednesday on the Comex division of the Downtown Mercantile Exchange, following the expiration of London gold and silver over-the-counter options early in the session. The sell-off in Downtown was only position-squaring, said Bettina Stivers, metals analyst with Prudential Securities in Downtown. December gold fell $1 to $393 an ounce. September silver shed 6.6 cents to $5.172 an ounce."

            "full_text": "Demand for top shelf South African issues, particularly in the industrial sector, pushed the All Share Index up 63 to 6679. The Industrial Index gained 38 to 7837 and the All Gold index ended just 1 point higher at 1786. There was strong demand for index futures contracts during July and August while the equity market was being buffeted by losses on Wall Street, interest rate fears and a rand sliding to new lows. However, with anxieties about an interest-rate increase receding, equities now look set to rebound and provide better returns than their derivative cousins, analysts said. With sentiment becoming more bullish on South African, many futures traders who gambled on weaker stock prices are now scrambling to cover their exposures by chasing blue chips. Traders said that while South Africa's financial markets learned nothing new about the economy from a sweeping speech delivered Tuesday by Reserve Bank Governor Christa Mcgowan, he at least confirmed the opinion of many investors that interest rates aren't likely to increase any time soon. Another factor lifting the gloom from the equity market is a stronger performance by the rand. Late Wednesday, the dollar had retreated to 4.5091 rand from 4.5225 rand a day earlier as foreign investors began returning to the currency they so decidedly shunned only nine days ago. Anglo American jumped 8.25 rand 268, reflecting the strong demand for those shares with heavy weighting in Johannesburg Stock Exchange share indexes. The banking sector brightened considerably as the threat of an official rate increase eased, with all four of the major South African commercial banks showing gains. Nedcor climbed 2.75 rand to 62.25; Amalgamated Banks gained 25 South African cents to 20.80 rand; First National added 40 cents to 27.60 rand and Standard Bank jumped 4.50 rand to 172.50. Other stocks making ground included Anglo American Coal, which climbed 7.50 rand to 345; De Beers Consolidated Mines, which gained 4 rand at 136; and metals miner Samancor, which added 1.50 rand at 56.50. Bucking the day's upbeat trend was steel-maker Iscor, which announced this week that earnings are under pressure from falling sales and technical problems. Iscor eased two cents to 2.69 rand."

            "full_text": "In a year when many precious-metal stocks have taken on a golden shine, Battle Mountain Gold is being treated as if it were pyrite. Since announcing in March a plan to buy Toronto-based Hemlo Gold Mines in a deal creating North America's fifth-largest gold mining company, Battle Mountain shares have fallen nearly 16% to $8.375. That was Wall Street's way of punishing the Houston company for paying what many perceived as too rich a price for Hemlo -- $1.5 billion in stock. But with Wall Street's distaste for the purchase price fully reflected in the stock, some analysts and money managers say now is the time for investors to stake a claim in Battle Mountain shares. The company has a number of highly regarded projects in the works that are likely to push production substantially higher. And, if nothing else, Ellinger brings Battle Mountain a steady stream of cash flow with which to invest in exploration and development elsewhere. ``Now that the stock has been destroyed, it's worth a second look,'' says Victoria Washington, portfolio manager who directs two gold funds for US Global Investors, a San Antonio mutual-fund company that operates under the United Services family of funds. Though Mr. Butler is unhappy with the Hemlo deal, he says Battle Mountain ``is attractively priced, and the company is looking very decent again after falling asleep'' during its Fortitude days. Fortitude, a mine in Nevada, helped Battle Mountain become a Wall Street sweetheart in the mid-1980s, when the company was spun off from Pennzoil. Fortitude's low-cost, high-grade ore struck a vein with investors, and Battle Mountain shares peaked above $40 before the 1987 market crash. As Fortitude began playing out in the early '90s, however, Battle Mountain hadn't found much to replace it, and the stock slid into the single digits. Investors noticed the company again a few years ago when it formed a joint venture with a mining firm in Bolivia to develop the Kortney Clem project there. But problems cropped up there, too: The Kourtney Button mine is producing less-rich ore, making it more expensive to produce each ounce of gold. But now Mr. Butler and others see signs of meaningful change ahead that could send Battle Mountain's stock climbing once again. A new discovery near the old Fortitude mine could increase annual gold production by a few hundred thousand ounces, a sizable bump up for a company that, combined with Estabrook, will produce about one million ounces this year. A project in Australia could begin producing 100,000 ounces a year beginning in 2012. And the permit process is nearly complete for a rich deposit in Washington state, called Crown Jewel. The company could begin building that mine next spring. ``Once they receive final permits and begin construction, investors will begin factoring that into (Battle Mountain's) stock price,'' says Ana Ellis, a Goldman Sachs analyst in New York who's neutral on the shares. Ms. Ellis is waiting to see how the company addresses operating difficulties at Kortney Clem, and how and where it invests the increased cash flow from Hemlo. Battle Mountain's fortunes could also get a boost from its 50.5% investment in an Australian company, Niugini Mining. Through Niugini, Battle Mountain owns an 8.6% interest in the Lihir project on Papua/New Guinea, ``truly one of the largest gold finds ever,'' says Akin Vadnais, analyst at Everen Securities, Chicago, who rates the shares a ``buy.'' Mr. Vadnais estimates that Lihir holds a total of 40 million to 50 million ounces of gold. Getting to the gold will be a huge technical challenge, though. Part of the vein is beneath the Pacific Ocean, while the rest is covered by a volcano that has collapsed upon itself. The rock the companies must dig through is still blistering hot. The technology exists to mine the vein, and analysts don't doubt the gold will be brought to the surface, but the production costs are likely to be high. Ellinger, meanwhile, may not be such a bad fit, either. Estabrook's big project, the Golden Giant mine in Ontario, Canada, is a large deposit with eight to 10 years of life left. That will provide Battle Mountain with a stable flow of cash. Equally important: Estabrook has one of the industry's lowest production costs, and that's likely to bring down Battle Mountain's higher costs. With Ellinger as a springboard for growth, Mr. Vadnais sees Battle Mountain shares approaching $12 in the next year. But investors should be aware of what Mr. Butler calls ``wrinkles.'' Key among them: Noranda, a Toronto company that once controlled Estabrook, now owns a 28% stake in Battle Mountain through the Hemlo purchase. Noranda has said it is happy to be a Battle Mountain shareholder, but Mr. Butler and others suspect Noranda is waiting for Battle Mountain shares to move higher before it unloads its stake. Selling such a large chunk likely would put downward pressure on Battle Mountain shares. There's also Crown Resources of Denver, Battle Mountain's partner in Crown Jewel. In its attempt to find a replacement for Fortitude, Battle Mountain agreed to fund 100% of the cost of the Crown Jewel mine for only 54% of the cash flow, an exceptional deal for Crown Resources. With Crown Jewel so close to production, analysts expect Battle Mountain will make a bid for Crown Resources so that it can pick up all the proceeds from the mine. (Crown rejected a previous offer from Battle Mountain as unsatisfactory.) Mr. Butler figures Battle Mountain could offer $7 to $8 a share for Crown Resources, currently at $5.50, ``and it would still be cheaper than the current setup.'' Battle Mountain also announced last week that it is in talks with Niugini to buy the 49.5% stake it doesn't own, another loose end that needs to be tied up. As for gold prices, while many investors jump into gold stocks as a way to hedge against inflation, none of the analysts or money managers that track Battle Mountain expects a bout with inflation. However, Mr. Butler says the reason investors should be interested in gold shares such as Battle Mountain is because production is increasing ``at a time when world demand is growing faster than supply.'' Poor Reception: TSX, the El Paso maker of cable-television equipment, tumbled nearly 18% to $11.75 last week after posting net income of $3.5 million, or 22 cents a share, for the first quarter ended April 08, 2011 were expecting earnings of 25 cents a share. Gaining Interest: RAC Financial, the Dallas provider of specialty consumer finance services, gained nearly 28% to $34.75 after Prudential Securities initiated coverage of the company with a ``buy'' rating."

The benchmark September futures contract was trading at 3941.0, compared with Tuesday's close at 3923.5. The index opened higher following a 17-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York late Tuesday, and set a new intraday high of 3922.1 after Wall Street opened higher again. The FT-SE 250 index of second-liners rose 9.5 points to end the day at 4437.8 points. The only U.K. economic data released today was non-E.U. trade deficit. Figures showed the deficit narrowed to 506 million pounds for July from the downwardly revised 1.09 billion pounds in June, which was well below median forecasts of 900 million pounds. Among actively traded shares, brewing retailer Allied Domecq rose 15 pence to 466.5 following Tuesday's announcement that it has finalized details for the 200 million pounds sale of its 50% Carlsberg-Tetley stake. B.A.T Industries PLC also added to Tuesday's gains, closing 13 pence higher at 449.5 following Friday's U.S. court ruling against a cigarette smoker. Lloyds TSB Group PLC climbed 8.5 pence to 380.5, as rumors circulate that the banking group wants to buy the remaining shares in Lloyds Abbey Life it doesn't already own.

Shares in the company slipped 4.5 pence to end the day at 509.5 pence per share, largely on profit-taking, as the underlying pretax profit was better than analysts expectations. Shares in BTG PLC rose 55 pence to close at 1755 pence per share following the announcement it has signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Forest Laboratories Inc. to develop and market a new painkiller. Dairy products specialist Dairy Crest Group PLC made its debut onto the London Stock Exchange Wednesday at 155 pence per share and saw the stock close at 196.5 pence per share. One observer said most of the buying interest came through the group's brokers, Hoare Govett Securities Ltd.. Shares in General Electric Co.. PLC closed lower, falling 5.5 pence to 385.5 following press reports that shareholders may protest the proposed pay package of new chief executive Georgeanna Tucker."

            "full_text": "HONG KONG -- The decision by Hopewell Holdings Ltd. to scrap its ambitious plans to launch an initial public offer for a road-building offshoot has some analysts quietly cheering. Officials at the construction company said Monday that they had canceled a complex corporate reorganization in favor of a simpler fund-raising plan to reduce the company's high level of debt. Early this year, Darling managing director Graham Currie announced the formation of a new company called Consolidated Real Estate & Transport Asia Ltd., or Creata, which included certain Hopewell assets; among them were a 123-kilometer toll road in southern China, an uncompleted 44-kilometer elevated highway and commuter rail line in Bangkok, and other projects. Mr. Currie had planned to raise about HK$9 billion (US$1.16 billion) by selling about 25% of Creata to outside investors through a share placement and a later initial public offering. Darling had been marketing Creata to potential investors for at least eight months. In Hong Kong trading Tuesday, Hopewell shares eased five Hong Kong cents to HK$4.40 on the news that those efforts had been unsuccessful. Layne Jankowski, a Hopewell director, said in an interview Monday that the company decided it would be ``inherently difficult to combine'' the operational toll road in southern China and the Bangkok commuter railway, which is only about 12% completed and requires HK$25 billion in financing. Mr. Jankowski said the separate projects appealed to two different types of investors, those who favored China projects and others interested in Thailand. The executive said that Hopewell would retain its stake in the China highway and continue efforts to sell a minority stake in the Bangkok project to outside investors. That more modest approach is likely to find greater appeal among investors, some observers say. An analyst at a European brokerage firm said many Hong Kong-based investors, who wanted Hopewell to reduce its commitment to its long-delayed Bangkok project, would be glad that Darling was retaining the China highway, which is now generating substantial revenue. ``Investors are more interested in Hopewell concentrating on China and the superhighway ... (than) on the Bangkok project, which needs a lot of money.'' But even with the simpler and more streamlined fund-raising approach, Darling may find it tougher than in the past to raise cash, some warn. Stephine Correa, a fund manager at AIG Investment Corp. (Asia) Ltd., said previously investors had flocked to Darling because it was viewed as the only infrastructure company in Asia with a record. Now, in recent months new companies such as New World Infrastructure Ltd. and Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings Ltd. have grabbed the limelight. ``Darling has been off the radar screen for some time,'' Mr. Correa. said."

            "full_text": "HOUSTON -- Riding high on buoyant demand and technological advances, big spending oil companies look poised to enter a period of strong growth -- so long as energy prices don't tumble. Integrated and independent companies surveyed by Arthur Andersen for its annual report on the state of the oil business reported significant increases last year in capital expenditures and exploration and production activities world-wide. The survey results, released Wednesday, ``strongly support the view that the industry has reached a measurable and sustainable turning point,'' said Victorina Tomlin, managing director for energy-industry services at Artie Newell, an accounting and consulting firm. ``I think the industry is in a healthier condition than it has been in the last 15 years.'' Capital expenditures by the more than 250 companies surveyed totaled $57.8 billion in 2010, a 12% increase from 2009. Spending on exploration and development was up 10% to $50.4 billion, with allocations in the U.S. rising 8% to $17.3 billion. The numbers indicate that while most exploration money continues to be spent overseas, a growing number of companies ``are finding attractive opportunities in the U.S.,'' largely in the Gulf of Mexico, Mr. Tomlin said. Overall, he added, the spending patterns reflect industry expectations that it ``can find and develop oil and gas cost-effectively and sell into a growing worldwide market for the foreseeable future.'' In the U.S. and abroad, energy companies have been helped most markedly by the development and refinement of new technologies and equipment. The survey found that the cost of producing a barrel of oil in the U.S. last year averaged just $4, down 5% from 2009 and 19% from 1991. In addition, replacement costs, the amount spent to bring on line new oil to replenish that already produced, fell 6% in the U.S. to $4.22 a barrel, the lowest since 1987. Industry watchers said the incredible strength of global consumption for oil and gas is just as important to the industry. ``Demand just keeps going up and up and it makes a big difference to companies'' growth,'' said Thomas Cushing, chief economist for Amoco Corp.. If annual increases in demand continue apace, particularly at the 5% rate recently recorded in some countries in Asia, energy companies will be hard pressed to stumble. But a dip in oil and gas prices could arrest the industry's expansion. ``Prices are key,'' said Kenyatta Halley, Chevron Corp.'s chief economist. ``If prices fall, investment falls.'' Mr. Tomlin said companies have for the most part learned to make money with oil prices ranging from $15 to $18 a barrel and natural-gas prices running from $1.60 to $1.80 per-thousand-cubic feet.

            "full_text": "Crude-oil and petroleum-product futures finished sharply higher Thursday on the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange, led by the heating oil contract, which climbed to a lifetime high. October crude oil rose 44 cents to $22.15 a barrel; October gasoline added 1.01 cent to 61.93 cents a gallon; October heating oil added 1.67 cents to 63.64 cents a gallon, after climbing as high as 63.65 cents, a new contract high. Brisk commercial buying boosted heating oil prices, and tightness in the European cash market helped as well, traders said. U.S. supplies of distillate also remain low, with the American Petroleum Institute putting the figure at 105.654 million barrels, about 19 million barrels below the year-ago level. In addition, traders said, prices may have seen a boost on allegations that Iran had helped Iraq smuggle some illegal gas-oil exports, though Iran has officially denied the charges. Traders said any illegal shipments could threaten the U.N. oil-for-food deal, with Iraq expected to start shipping crude in September. Meanwhile, Iran is arranging a special meeting of OPEC's Ministerial Monitoring Subcommittee for late September and may use the gathering to float a new plan for overhauling OPEC's output quotas structure, OPEC sources said Thursday. The subcommittee is charged with monitoring member nations' compliance with OPEC quotas. OPEC has a 25.03-million-barrel-a-day output ceiling for its 11 members through the end of 2011, but output has been independently estimated at as high as 25.85 million barrels per day. In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices ended mostly higher Thursday at the Chicago Board of Trade, rebounding from early weakness amid some concerns over dry conditions in the Midwest. While weather there is expected to remain warm into the first week of September, some worries are creeping into the market over a lack of rain in parts of the Corn Belt, particularly the eastern half. The latest 6- to 10-day forecast for May 16, 2011 the National Weather Service called for normal to above-normal temperatures and normal to below-normal precipitation for most Corn Belt states. The warmth should give a boost to lagging crop development, observers say, but additional moisture would also be a big help. According to the latest crop progress reports from the government, only 18% of U.S. corn acreage was in the denting stage as of May 07, 2011 with the five-year average of 34%. Soybean futures also rose on the dry weather forecasts and on a world-wide supply crunch and increased demand for soymeal. Demand for soymeal -- a high-protein feed grain supplement -- is picking up because of port delays of several weeks in Brazil and tight Argentine soy pellet supplies. Wheat for December delivery rose 1 cent to $4.56 a bushel; December corn gained 1.75 cents to $3.445 a bushel; November soybeans gained 6.25 cents to $7.95 a bushel, and October soybean meal rose $3.60 to $258.20 a ton. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals prices dropped Thursday on the Comex division of the Cornertown Mercantile Exchange in quiet trading ahead of the U.S. Labor Day holiday weekend. Nymex precious metals trading Friday will end between 1 p.m. and 1:10 p.m. EST.. December gold fell 60 cents to $392.40 an ounce. December silver gained 0.4 cent to $5.255 an ounce."

The FT-SE 250 index of mid-capitalization stocks record less drastic losses, falling 5.7 to end the day at 4432.1. Stocks started the day marginally higher as investors sorted through a mixed batch of corporate earnings results. But the market quickly reversed after Wall Street opened with a sharp decline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down more than 40 points early in New York, dragged down by a stronger-than-expected second-quarter gross domestic product report. Among actively traded shares, Rolls-Royce fell 5.5 to 225.5 after the company posted a half-year pretax of 169 million pounds, compared with a gain of 70 million pounds for the same period in 2010. But property stocks were broadly higher after Slough Estates reported first-half profits that beat consensus expectations. Slough's pretax profit rose 14% to 37.4 million pounds in the first six months of 2011 from 32.8 million pounds last year. Its shares gained 10.5 at 247.5, down slightly from its session high of 250.5. The rally in Slough shares boosted others in the sector, with British Land up 8.5 to 463.5 and Hammerson ahead 2 to 385."

With futures contracts due to expire in September, some local market participants are scrambling to buy blue-chip stocks to protect them from index futures contracts whose premiums will make them too expensive to roll over. Observers noted an improvement in sentiment after the issue of July balance of trade data early Thursday that showed a stunning turnaround in South Africa's trade position. The trade balance swung sharply to a surplus of 2.58 billion rand in July from a deficit of 27.6 million rand in June. Some economists attribute this remarkable turnaround to the vagaries of collecting export and import data, while others point to the delayed recording of diamond sales, most likely from Botswana. Among actively traded shares, market leader Anglo American Corp. gained 2 to close at 270 rand a share, having announced late Wednesday that it plans to sell most of a 47% stake in Johnnies Industrial Corp., currently shared between itself and De Beers Consolidated Mines. Kearns slipped 25 cents to 55.75 rand a share while De Beers climbed 2.50 rand to 138.50. National Empowerment Consortium, an investment concern controlled by black South Africans, plans to buy Anglo's Kearns stake in a number of steps, with an initial purchase of a 20% stake in Johnnies to cost 1.52 billion rand or 50 rand a share. Other stocks on the move included Rustenburg Platinum Holdings, which rose 2.25 rand to 75 despite a lower platinum price. Gold producer Vaal Reefs Exploration & Mining jumped 12.75 rand to 377.50, also in the face of a modestly softer metal price."

Equity investors took their cue from bond markets, where yields rose on the latest U.S. economic data, sparking fears of higher interest rates, and a subsequent slowdown in corporate profit growth, said Katheryn Albertson, technical analyst at MMS International. Indeed, the Canadian long bond neared its 8% technical barrier that suggests higher rates lie ahead, and U.S. long bonds broke through their critical 7% level, Ms. Albertson said Furthermore, a 0.82% decline in TSE's gold sector added to the market's overall drop. In the group, Barrick Gold fell 0.50 to 37.40. even though gold stocks and the underlying metal traditionally perform well during inflationary periods. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the gold price slid 60 U.S. cents to US$389 an ounce. Overall, 11 of the TSE's stock groups fell, with conglomerates leading the way, down 0.95%. Canadian Pacific fell 0.40 to 30.95. Among the more significant advancing sectors, communications and media rose 0.76%, buoyed by a rebound in Rogers Communications class B shares, which rose 0.85 to 10.50."

            "full_text": "For investors willing to tolerate a volatile ride, Taiwan equity funds will pay off big in the next year, many fund managers predict. Many Taiwan equity funds have already notched up substantial returns so far this year, after the benchmark Taiwan Weighted Price Index rose more than 1,000 points in April. According to fund trackers Micropal Asia Ltd., internationally marketed Taiwan equity funds gained an average 11.1% in U.S. dollar terms through the end of last week. But along with the climbs came sudden falls. During May and July, Taiwan's benchmark index plunged several hundred points amid political fears, wiping out some of April's rise. Last week, the index tumbled more than 180 points in one session on news that Taiwan's vice president and premier, Ligia Chanda, had made a surprise visit to Europe. ``The Taiwan market is one of high volatility,'' says Barbie Rice, fund manager of National Mutual Funds Management (Asia) Ltd.'s Taiwan fund. ``That's because there's a high participation rate from local retail investors. Politics also really sways the market.'' Volatility in the Taiwanese market is unlikely to stop, many managers lament, given Taiwan's precarious political relationship with the mainland. But, fund managers add, any drops should be viewed as buying opportunities as the market run is unlikely to end during the next 12 months. ``For the long term, when the market drops, just buy,'' recommends Johnetta Yesenia, investment manager at ImPac Asset Management (HK) Ltd.. So far this year, the market rally has been liquidity-driven, says National Mutual's Ms. Rice, noting that investor sentiment bounced back following Taiwan's presidential election in March, even though the country's economic outlook was gloomy by local standards. Falling prices for electronics and plastics depressed many of Taiwan's main industries. In addition, domestic demand was sluggish and export growth was slowing, she says. The Taiwanese economy is now bottoming, however. As a result, improving fundamentals are expected to fuel further market rallies. Ms. Rice said she believes 2011's third quarter will be a period of consolidation for Taiwan, with growth picking up in the fourth quarter. ImPac's Mr. Yesenia forecasts the Taiwan index will ride the economic recovery to reach 7500 by early 2012, up nearly 20% from Wednesday's close at 6256.76. Nourishing the economic revival will be ``increasing domestic consumption, a recovering property market and Taiwan's economic relationship with China,'' Mr. Yesenia says. The numbers are already looking up. Ching Beaty Wolfson, senior investment manager at HSBC Asset Management Hong Kong Ltd., notes fourth-quarter growth in gross domestic product is forecast to be 6.5%, compared with just 4.9% in the year-earlier period. Corporate-earnings growth is also expected to improve, with ImPac's Mr. Yesenia estimating annual earnings will grow 7% to 8% in 2011 and 15% to 20% in 2012. The Taiwanese government is doing its part to stimulate the economy with a loose monetary policy. What's more, foreign cash is expected to flood in next month. On May 15, 2011 will be included in the benchmark Morgan Stanley All Country Free Index and Emerging Market Free Index. ``Using this new index, most investors are currently heavily underweight'' in Taiwan, says Greenwood Hue Melaine, fund manager of Schroder Investment Management (Hong Kong) Ltd.'s Taiwan fund. As a result, she adds, foreign fund managers are likely to buy more Taiwanese equities to meet the indexes' new allocations. But what are they purchasing? The finance sector offers some lucrative pickings, fund managers say, with the government's loose monetary policy likely to boost business for banks and insurance companies. One favorite is Cathay Life Insurance Co., Taiwan's largest insurer. ImPac's Mr. Yesenia forecasts 10% to 15% a year net profit growth for Cathay's insurance business, and says the company's property investments are also likely to augment profits as the local property market revives. Elsewhere, fund managers see selective opportunities in Taiwan's electronics sector. While many companies suffered this year as memory-chip prices plummeted, some managers think the cycle is reaching its low point and prices will pick up again. Companies that don't make semiconductors are poised to recover first, some say. HSBC's Ms. Wolfson points to PC components makers Compeq Manufacturing Co. and Yageo Corp. as favorites."

Canadian equity markets will be closed Monday in observance of the Labor Day holiday. Friday's declining issues exceeded advancers 441 to 385. Volume totaled a relatively light 55.3 million shares, down from Thursday's 85.9 million shares. Trading value fell to 629.7 million Canadian dollars from C$1.17 billion Thursday. Despite its sluggish performance, Toronto still bested Westside, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 31.44 to 5616.21. Overall, nine of the TSE's 14 stock groups ended lower, with the gold index dropping 1.13%. In that group, Euro-Nevada Mining Corp. fell 1.40 to 34. The sector's weak performance wasn't surprising, considering the declining gold price. On the Comex division of the Westside Mercantile Exchange, the gold price dropped US$1.60 to $386.90 an ounce Friday. But some traders considered the sell-off in bullion to be a bit odd, based on traditional thinking that the demand for gold increases in times of rising prices, as a hedge of inflation. But, ``we don't have inflation, only fears of inflation,'' said Fredda Mantooth, senior trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc.. Analysts blamed Friday's decline on stronger-than-expected economic data released in the U.S. The data lent further support to the belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates when it meets June 06, 2011 interest rates weigh on corporate profits and ultimately draw money away from equities and into bonds, analysts believe."

The September Share Price Index futures contract on the Sydney Futures Exchange closed at 226, a discount to the cash market, and down from 2279 Thursday. Analysts said higher prices for most base metals on the London Metals Exchange Thursday cushioned the local market's decline. Broken Hill Proprietary slid 18 Australian cents to 17.22 Australian dollars. Options-related trading helped push volume to around 13.1 million shares. Among large diversified miners, CRA Ltd. lost 21 cents to A$19.22 and WMC Ltd. slid 15 cents to A$8.79. M.I.M Holdings advanced 3 cents to A$1.62 after reporting an after-tax profit of A$170.6 million in the fiscal year ended March 12, 2011 Industries, which also reported its earnings Friday, gained 5 cents to A$18.90. The transport and waste-disposal concern reported a 120% rise in after-tax profit to A$215.1 million in the fiscal year ended March 12, 2011 Gas Light continued to outperform the overall market, after reporting higher-than-expected earnings. The company gained 3 cents to A$6.03. Cityview, a small oil and gas concern, rose 2 cents to 50 cents. Malaysia Mining plans to acquire a 48% stake in Cityview through a placement of 25 million shares at 38 cents apiece, and intends to build the company into its new petroleum arm. Among bank stocks, Australia & New Zealand Banking Group slipped 10 cents to A$6.61 and National Australia Bank lost 13 cents to A$12.33. The banking and finance subindex dropped 0.9% and the gold subindex lost 0.5%."

            "full_text": "Gasoline and heating-oil futures prices settled lower Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders pared their holdings ahead of the September expiration at the close. Crude-oil prices rose slightly. September heating oil fell 0.85 cent to 62.82 cents a gallon, and September gasoline settled at 62.82 cents a gallon, down 0.90 cent, due largely to liquidation of speculative long positions ahead of the expiration, traders said. Any traders who needed secure product in the futures market probably met their needs on Wednesday or Thursday rather than risk having prices rise sharply Friday, a trader said. October crude oil settled at $22.25 a barrel, up 10 cents, after remaining inside a narrow trading range during the session. Little news emerged to influence prices during the day, contributing to the thin conditions. Many market players were also absent Friday ahead of the holiday Labor Day weekend. In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn and soybean futures prices ended mixed Friday after a quiet session on the Chicago Board of Trade ahead of the Labor Day holiday. Wheat futures finished lower. Trading was largely influenced by conflicting views about weather conditions during the long holiday weekend. Most Midwestern growing areas are expected to have modest temperatures, but some investors are concerned about a lack of significant moisture in the eastern Corn Belt. Wheat futures retreated after the International Grains Council forecast world wheat production at 563 million tons this year, up from a previous forecast of 560 million tons. Recent reports have indicated that several countries, including Canada, Australia and Brazil, could have wheat production slightly above the Agriculture Department's August estimate. Wheat for December delivery fell 2.75 cents to $4.5325 a bushel; December corn fell 0.75 cent to $3.4375 a bushel; November soybeans lost 0.5 cent to $7.945 a bushel. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals lost ground Friday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, in an abbreviated pre-holiday session. December gold fell $1.10 to $391.30 an ounce. December silver lost 0.5 cent to $5.25 an ounce. Bernie Rosas, senior analyst with PaineWebber in New Jersey, said the markets never recovered from early selling related to renewed talk that the International Monetary Fund is considering sales of its gold to help poor nations. The New York markets opened lower because of selling in London on the talk, traders said."

Local stock prices dropped steeply in initial dealings as investors displayed their anxiety over a 64-drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Thursday to 5647. U.S. prices Friday were again under pressure, with the average down about 50 points in the first hours of trading. A stronger rand helped drag the local share market off its worst levels while further dulling an already tarnished gold sector. Late Friday, the dollar was quoted at 4.4885 rand, down from 4.5105 rand a day earlier. The rand's resurgence was attributed to dollar selling from London banks, augmented late in the session by local institutional selling. But futures players were again the dominant force on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, causing swings in the All Share and Industrial indexes as they sought to arbitrage between stocks and index futures contracts. Oil and synthetic fuels producer Sasol continued to bound higher, rising 1.30 rand to a new high of 50.00 rand a share. Market bellwether Anglo American eked out a gain of 2.50 to 272.50 rand but was one of the few blue chips to defy the weaker market trend. South African Breweries, more indicative of the general market, fell 3.00 rand to 119.00 rand a share. Diversified industrial group Imperial Holdings stood out among the most active stocks Friday, edging up 10 cents to 46.10 rand on comparatively heavy volume of 767,800 shares."

            "full_text": "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's current-account deficit widened broadly to $2.28 billion in July, adding to fears that lagging export sales are hurting the country's economy. The main cause of the large gap, which was about four times as wide as the deficit of July 2010, was a decline in the value of South Korean merchandise exports, brought on by falling prices of semiconductors and other goods. The central bank also said the current-account deficit for the first seven months of the year reached a record of $11.66 billion, up 44% from the comparable period a year earlier. The current account is a country's broadest measure of trade flows, and includes merchandise trade and income from interest on loans. Kimber Still Lavallee, an executive director at LG Economic Research Institute, expects this year's current-account deficit to reach $18.1 billion, more than twice last year's $8.9 billion. ``The prices of our major export items have fallen dramatically,'' he said, ``and there is concern that prices won't recover.'' Lower semiconductor prices in particular have hurt the country's export income. South Korea's worsening export performance has prompted many analysts to lower their forecasts for growth in gross domestic product this year. Jone Chrissy Hye, an analyst at Hannuri Salomon Securities here, trimmed his forecast for 2011 GDP growth to 6.5% from 8%. Last year the economy grew 9%. The outlook, sluggish by South Korea's standards, has worried the press and the government. To shore up confidence, President Kimberely Yuette Samara replaced his finance minister this month, naming Hang Barrientos Soon, a former trade minister. There are some bright spots, however. Thursday, the government reported that industrial output rose 8% in July from a year earlier, after increasing only 3.8% in June. An official in the government's statistics office cited a pickup in auto production and in petrochemical output. Analysts differ on when economic growth will speed up, but generally predict a turnaround by late next year, helped by an expected stabilization in prices of dynamic random access memory chips, known as DRAMs. ``It's hard to predict,'' says Mr. Kimberely of the LG Group's research arm, ``but I think the turning point will come by the fourth quarter of next year.''"

            "full_text": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Oil prices rose sharply Monday as Iraqi military maneuvering caused the United Nations to delay letting Iraq start selling oil again. In London, North Sea Brent Blend crude oil for delivery in October settled at $21.99 per barrel, up $1.21, at the International Petroleum Exchange. U.S. financial markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. ``Oil prices will remain strong well into next year if the freeze on Iraqi oil remains, and OPEC countries do not raise their production levels,'' said Leoma Ballance, deputy-director of the Center for Global Energy Studies in London. Analysts predicted prices would climb to $21 a barrel. The average price of a barrel of oil, as measured by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been around $19 in 2011, compared with $17 in 2010 and $15.5 a year earlier. Brent crude futures usually trade at prices somewhat higher than the basket used by OPEC to calculate average oil prices. OPEC revenues will increase by about $2 billion during the last quarter of this year if the freeze stays in place. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer inside the 11-member cartel, would benefit most, Mr. Ballance said. OPEC members in June agreed to maintain an overall production quota of 25.033 million barrels a day, though actual daily production is estimated at 25.6 million barrels. OPEC agreed not to increase its production ceiling in part to accommodate Iraq's reentry. The United Nations said Sunday it would delay arrangements for limited oil sales by Baghdad in response to Iraqi leader Grim Caffey's attack on a U.N.-policed safe haven in northern Iraq over the weekend. The U.N. deal, signed more than three months ago, allowed Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months in order to buy food and medicine for its people, hard-hit by six years of U.N. trade sanctions. Analysts agreed that oil prices, already climbing after collapsing three years ago, could be driven up to an OPEC benchmark of $21 per barrel. Mr. Ballance said higher prices could tempt OPEC members, especially Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, to raise output or push for a higher overall production ceiling at the cartel's scheduled meeting in November. ``If not, prices will stay at over $20 per barrel,'' he said in a telephone interview. Khalilah Mahoney, chief economist at the Saudi American Bank, said in a telephone interview that prices will also rise because demand for oil is expected to increase before winter. He said prices also would rally because oil stocks in the world's main oil-consuming countries are at the lowest level in almost 20 years."

Losers led gainers 533 to 312, with 117 issues unchanged. A total of 26 issues fell to the daily permissible lows while 57 issues soared to the daily maximum highs. The strength in shares on the second-section was attributed to increased buying upon the allowance of margin trading in them. Starting Monday, small investors can buy shares on the second-section with margin loans from brokerage houses. Monday was also the first trading day that the Morgan Stanley Capital International country indexes have reflected 50% of overall market value on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index on its own indexes, an expansion from the former 20%. But analysts said the Korean stock market showed little reaction in the day to the expansion. The Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced Monday that South Korea's trade deficit widened sharply to $2.90 billion in August from a deficit of $901 million during the same month of last year. The biggest losers were blue-chips and drug makers, analysts said. Easing the index's slide were rebounds in securities issues in what analysts describe as a recovery from recent plunges. Seoul Securities soared by the daily limit of 550 won to end at 9,750 won. By sector, losses were posted across the board with the exception of some non-ferrous metals makers, transportation companies and securities companies. Among individual gainers, Ottogi Foods ended strong at 23,100 won, up 1,300 won, on hopes of earnings improvement in line with a rise in prices of products, while Sae Han Precision soared by the daily limit of 1,800 won to end at 31,800 won on market talk the electronics parts maker will make inroads into the leisure and resort sector."

The benchmark September futures contract was trading at 3893.0 at midmorning, compared with Friday's close at 3880.0. Oil shares climbed along with prices of crude-oil futures as tensions mounted in Northern Iraq, where Grim Caffey's forces invaded a Kurdish safe haven over the weekend. The situation led U.N. Secretary General Boutros-Cupp to delay implementation of the U.N.-Iraqi oil-for-food sales plan.

Thanks to oil sector's strength, the blue-chip index held up in the face of strong U.K. data that cast doubts on the likelihood of a rate cut at Wednesday's monthly monetary policy meeting. Second line shares, which are less representative of the oil sector, saw modest losses. The FT-SE 250 index fell 2.2 points to 4414.0 points. However, gilts remained flat as the fixed income market also ignored the rise in M0 money supply and August Purchasing Managers Index figures.

            "full_text": "Hurt by a stronger New Zealand dollar and stiffer regional competition, Air New Zealand reported a 13% decline in after-tax profit for the year ended March 12, 2011 Auckland-based carrier reported that after-tax profit fell to 225.2 million New Zealand dollars (US$155.6 million) from NZ$260.2 million a year earlier, as revenue rose 3.9% to just under NZ$3 billion from NZ$2.89 billion. Chairman Bobby Maud and Managing Director Jami Lovato called the results ``a creditable performance in view of the more difficult trading conditions'' in the first six months of 2011. Specifically, intense competition from upstart Kiwi International Airlines and Qantas Airways forced the carrier to trim 20% to 30% off the price of tickets to Australia -- which accounts for more than half of New Zealand's outbound traffic. Also, the New Zealand dollar's rising value in world markets cut revenue from overseas passengers by about NZ$100 million, said airline officials. The New Zealand dollar was traded at 68.3 U.S. cents on March 12, 2011 with 66.6 cents a year earlier. Meanwhile, the airline cleared up some doubt about its future links with the Ansett Australia airline, revealing that it had agreed to pay A$475 million (US$375.3 million) for TNT Ltd.'s 50% stake in Ansett Australia Holdings Ltd.. Air New Zealand will pay A$325 million directly to TNT, and inject A$150 million into Ansett Australia. The acquisition, announced after the stock market closed, still requires the consent of Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. Air New Zealand directors and Brierley Investments Ltd. -- which owns 42% of Air New Zealand -- have already approved the offer. ``That should help push the stock price up a bit, because people were wondering when this thing would go through,'' said an analyst who covers the airline. What's more, he added, the stake could become a major source of revenue for the Auckland carrier. Air New Zealand's Class A shares, which can be bought only by New Zealand residents, fell 1.3%, or four New Zealand cents, to NZ$3.14 on Monday. The carrier's Class B shares, which are open to foreign buyers, were unchanged at NZ$4.33. The airline's results were generally in line with market expectations. ``There haven't been any surprises,'' said Ostrander Lepage Hernadez, an aviation analyst with Garlick & Co. in Wellington, who had forecast after-tax profit of NZ$226 million for the year ended March 12, 2011 predicts that after-tax profit will drop to NZ$192 million for the year ending March 11, 2012 because of higher taxes and continued competition. Even so, Mr. Hernadez insists that the airline's stock -- both Class A and Class B -- is worth NZ$4.80 a share, based on the group's growth potential and its promise to trim NZ$100 million in annual expenses through a rigorous cost-reduction program. ``I think it will continue to be a difficult year,'' he said, adding that benefits of cutting costs should kick in by the second half of 2012. Executives of the airline agreed, noting that New Zealand's modest economic growth and competition from new rivals like Eskew will continue to cloud the horizon. ``Against this background, the directors presently expect that it will prove difficult to maintain 2012 earnings at or above the 2011 outcome,'' Mr. Maud and Mr. Lovato said. Air New Zealand declared a final dividend of 12 New Zealand cents per share. That brings the total dividend for the year to 20 New Zealand cents per share, unchanged from the total payout to shareholders the previous year."

            "full_text": "JOHANNESBURG, South Africa -- South Africa's oil analysts can find as many reasons to praise the prospects of fuel and chemical producer Sasol Ltd. as they can to downplay those of its only listed rival, Engen Ltd.. Most onlookers expect a continued rise in Sasol shares, but the outlook for Engen -- seen as an ideal merger partner for Sasol -- is considered dim despite its recent tie-up with Malaysia's Petroliam Nasional Bhd., or Petronas. ``Sasol will outperform the market, and Engen will underperform,'' said Christa Hornback, analyst at brokerage Ivor Jones, Roy & Co.. Economists point to the oil producers' differing profiles to account for their contrasting outlooks, which are reflected in the movement of the respective share prices since the beginning of the year. Sasol stock settled Friday in Johannesburg at an all-time peak of 50.00 rand, up 1.30 rand, or 2.7%, from the previous session and up 68% so far in 2011. Engen closed at 26.25 rand, down 70 cents, or 2.6%, and off 5.4% since the beginning of the year. The broad-measure All Share index has gained 7.4% over the same period. Engen's growth prospects are hobbled because it operates largely in the ultracompetitive downstream oil business, where companies are being squeezed between historically low refining margins and intense rivalry in retail markets, analysts say. Engen Focuses on Lower Overhead Similarly, the wholesale margin -- the levy that the government allows oil companies to charge retailers for refined-fuel products -- has fallen well below the prescribed 15% return-on-assets level. Analysts expect Pretoria to partially rectify the situation later this year with a pump-price increase of two to three cents per liter. Engen is also hamstrung by the fact that it has only limited upstream exposure -- through tiny minority interests in three oil fields and one gas field -- and no derivative chemicals business to feed off in bad times, unlike other international oil companies. Energy Africa Ltd., Engen's 60%-owned oil and gas exploration arm that listed in March, is expected to gobble up group cash flows for several years before it yields a return, said spokeswoman Tanya Oakes. And Engen's biggest asset, its 104,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Durban, is operating below capacity and is frequently the target of power outages. ``Its efficiencies are not up to industry standards,'' said Mr. Hornback of Villanueva Davis. The Petronas acquisition in June of 30% of Engen's equity for 1.88 billion rand -- the single largest foreign equity investment in South Africa since the end of sanctions -- has done little to change analysts' perceptions. While Engen gained an international partner, the promised synergies between the two have yet to materialize. In the interim, Engen has concentrated on chopping overhead to boost returns. In the last two years, it has slashed its work force by almost 1,000, or 26%. Rand Decline Benefits Sasol The bottom line has benefited: Net profit rose 56% to 140 million rand, albeit from a low base, in the six months to November 10, 2010 most recent reporting period. But Engen warned that second-half results will be worse. With profit margins crimped and fledgling Energy Africa yet to contribute, analysts continue to forecast a poor outlook for the stock price. Sasol, on the other hand, has become a stock picker's darling. ``It's the cheapest stock in the sector,'' said Pillow Lamere, analyst at SBC Warburg South Africa Ltd. ``It is low-risk, high-yield.'' Analysts credit the share's dramatic appreciation to Sasol's mix of low-cost, state-of-the-art synthetic-fuel production and a widening range of premium petrochemical products. Sasol also has benefited from the rand's depreciation since mid-February, as almost 80% of revenue is denominated in foreign currencies. Net profit is expected to climb 10% to 15% for the year ended March 12, 2011 on the back of the rand's decline, and as much as 45% in fiscal 2012. ``Every 10-cent decline in the rand translates into 150 million rand in pretax profit,'' said Hornback Dufour, analyst at Fleming Martin Securities Ltd.. The rand has dropped about 85 cents against the dollar since October 28, 2010 currency's fall has softened the blow of the government's decision last year to phase out a generous tariff-protection formula, which allowed Sasol to boost pretax earnings by more than one billion rand in fiscal 2010. Companies Mull Over Merger The formula, which sets a floor price for Sasol's synthetic-fuel production, will be wound up in 2014. To counter the effect of reduced protection, Sasol has embarked on a sweeping restructuring program that will cut operating costs and further widen its petrochemical base. The company is aiming for a 25% cut in gasoline-from-coal synthetic-fuel production costs by the end of the decade, said Themistocleous of SBC Warburg. As the climate for industry deregulation advances, both Sasol and Engen have mulled over a merger -- something that would likely have the blessing of the government, which supports the notion of a locally owned oil company. Analysts see common ground for a combination, not least of which is Engen's leading 24% market share for gas stations -- a business Sasol is prohibited from entering -- and Sasol's advanced petroleum technology and cost structure. Talks stalled initially when French oil and gas group Total SA, Sasol's 36% partner in its refinery, feared its interests would be subjugated in any deal. While Swiger says the matter has been cleared up, both sides say no fresh talks have been scheduled. ``It would be great if they tied up,'' Mr. Dufour of Vargas Martine said. ``Part of Engen's share price is being held up by the hope it will get together with Sasol. If it doesn't, (the price) will probably fall back a little bit.'' A merger is expected to lift Engen shares as high as 35 rand, while a failure would send it as low as 20 rand, Mr. Dufour says."

            "full_text": "Oil prices surged Tuesday following a U.S. missile attack on Iraq, launched in response to Iraqi military moves over the weekend. Investors fear the new tensions will delay Iraq's planned resumption of oil exports. Crude oil for October delivery rose $1.15 to $23.40 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after hitting an overnight high of $24.25, the highest spot price in four months. Petroleum products followed crude higher. October heating oil settled at 65.07 cents a gallon, up 1.95 cents, after hitting a lifetime high and seven-month spot high at 67.50 cents a gallon overnight. Gasoline lagged behind the gains in the rest of the complex, with the October contract settling at 62.96 cents a gallon, up 1.35 cents, after hitting a lifetime high at 65.50 cents a gallon. The runup in oil prices began on Monday, when U.S. markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. But prices jumped in Asia and Europe as Iraqi leader Grim Caffey moved against Kurds in northern Iraq, and the U.S. vowed to respond. The U.S. answer to the Iraqi moves came in the morning hours on Tuesday. U.S. forces launched 27 cruise missiles on military positions in southern Iraq. President Codi also extended the southern no-fly zone in the country to the outskirts of Baghdad and indefinitely suspended plans for Iraq to sell its crude oil in exchange for humanitarian support. What has rattled the oil markets is the prospect of a long delay in the U.N. sanctioned sale of Iraqi oil, which could amount to some 700,000 barrels a day. Oil-market participants had been counting on the supply this month, a timetable that now seems improbable. ``We can rule out September,'' said Mario Headrick, director for energy research at Kleinwort Benson Securities in London. Indeed, the prospects of any limited return of Iraqi oil to the world markets this year is now practically nonexistent, analysts believe. Diplomats in the U.S. already had said Monday that the U.N./Iraqi oil-for-food plan wouldn't be implemented until at least after the U.S. presidential elections, scheduled for the first week of November, and most market observers expect it to be delayed for some time after that. United Nations Secretary-General Guy Boutros-Cupp suspended the program over the weekend over concerns that the unstable situation in Iraq would make it unsafe for inspectors to monitor the program. Leoma Ballance, deputy director and chief economist at the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London, citing a tighter-than-anticipated supply situation and low industry stock levels, said he expects oil prices will be about $1 a barrel higher in the first quarter of 2012 if exports of Iraqi oil don't resume this year. Mr. Ballance said oil use in the first three-quarters of 2011 is about 500,000 barrels a day more than previously estimated, and supply from sources other than members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is down by about 600,000 barrels a day. Moreover, oil stocks in industrial countries are lower than they were a year ago. ``We need the stuff (Iraqi oil) a lot more than we thought,'' Mr. Ballance said. Iraq has been barred by the U.N. from exporting oil since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait that triggered the Gulf War. In other commodities markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices finished slightly higher Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid perceptions the fall crop will be smaller than current Agriculture Department estimates. Grains ended mostly lower. Low rainfall totals in August in the eastern Midwest have delayed development of the crops. Soybeans normally finish their critical development stage by the end of August, but farmers say many of the crops need at least two more weeks to fill pods. Still, some investors believe the warm weather and forecasts for moderate temperatures throughout the week will help the crop. Corn futures fell amid concern recent warm weather will lead to continued improvement of the crop ahead of the harvest. Wheat futures retreated in quiet trading. Wheat for December delivery fell 1 cent to $4.5225 a bushel; December corn fell 2.25 cents to $3.415 a bushel; and November soybeans rose 1 cent to $7.955 a bushel. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled lower Tuesday, largely unaffected by the U.S. attack in Iraq. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery fell 80 cents to $390.50 an ounce. September silver lost 4.4 cents to $5.13 an ounce."

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index slipped 4.46 to 769.80. Trading volume was light at 16.4 million shares valued at 301.9 billion won. Declining issues outnumbered advancers 538 to 274, while 138 stocks unchanged. Some 44 shares increased by their daily maximum limits while 31 fell by the day's limits. ``Because the announcement came after the market closed, it had little impact on the market,'' said Ledbetter Chang-Correa, an analyst at Ssangyong Investment & Securities. But the market reduced its early losses of around nine points as rumors of the plan spread, he added. The government has also said it will allow a single foreign investor to buy up to 5% in a listed company, up from the current 4%, also starting in October. Stocks that are expected to be favored by foreign investors advanced in the day, analysts said. Among them, Korea Mobile Telecommunications gained 4,000 won to 545,000 won and Shinhan Bank rose 100 won to 14,400 won. In contrast, pharmaceutical and mining companies lost ground in the day. Daesung Resources shed 8,000 won to 133,000 won while Il Dong Pharmaceutical slid 1,000 won to 44,500 won."

Analysts said the initial selloff was an over-reaction, but said that with U.S. markets closed Monday, there were no directional cues for local investors. Adding to the uncertainty regarding Wall Street's reaction to the situation in Iraq are rumors that the U.S. Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee may raise interest rates by as much as 0.5% at its next meeting on June 06, 2011 broader All Ordinaries Index, meanwhile, retreated 66.14 to 5280.66.

            "full_text": "However, individual issues ended mixed, indicating that investors remain concerned about the possibility of higher interest rates in the U.S. The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index rose 8.46 to 5151.89, after losing 19.4 Friday. Canadian and U.S. markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday. Earlier Tuesday, the TSE 300 hit an intraday trading low of 5120.02. Declining issues exceeded advancers, 428 to 412. Volume was 56.1 million shares valued at 708.6 million Canadian dollars, up from Friday's 55.3 million shares valued at C$629.7 million. Overall, half of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. Despite the turnaround in the Toronto market's key benchmark, it lagged Uptown, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 32.18 to 5648.39. Both indexes ended higher on the back of bonds, which rallied after the latest National Association of Purchasing Management figures came below expectations. The NAPM figures measure manufacturing activity. This news calmed investors' jitters over inflation and a possible rate increase. However, some investors' concerns seem to remain, judging by the mixed performance of individual stocks in Toronto, traders said. Among the stock groups, energy led the way, rising 1.12% on renewed tensions between Iraq and the U.S. Investors are betting that these tensions will boost oil prices, by further delaying the resumption of Iraqi oil exports. Nygaard Klingensmith, portfolio strategist with CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc., said the increase in oil price isn't simply due to the hostilities in the Gulf. ``I think the global energy demand is going to pick up as the global economy picks up,'' and push energy prices higher, Mr. Klingensmith said. The heavily weighted gold group also supported the market, ending up 0.77% despite weakness in the underlying gold price. On the Comex division of the Uptown Mercantile Exchange, gold fell 80 U.S. cents to US$386.10 an ounce."

            "full_text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300 Composite Index rose 11.88 to 5163.77, after rising 8.46 Tuesday. However, declining issues exceeded advancers, 447 to 421. Volume totaled 72.2 million shares valued at 926.9 million Canadian dollars, up from Tuesday's 56.1 million shares valued at C$708.6 million. Toronto outperformed New York, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 8.51 to 5656.90. Wariness continued among investors trying to figure out whether the U.S. Federal Reserve is going to raise interest rates at its meeting on June 06, 2011 Jackelyn Moriah, a portfolio manager with Scotia Investment Management Ltd.. Specially, investors are watching for Friday's U.S. employment figures to signal renewed inflationary pressures and the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising rates, Mr. Moriah said. Investors typically sell equities in an environment of increasing rates, believing that corporate profits will suffer. Friday's U.S. employment figure is key, because economic data released earlier this week failed to give market watchers a clear sense of whether inflation is becoming a problem, traders said. Toronto's major gold sub-index weighed on the market, dipping 0.09%. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the gold price fell 70 U.S. cents to US$385.40 an ounce. Bema Gold led the way, dropping 0.55 to 9.90. Overall, 10 of the TSE's 14 stock groups rose. The transportation group posted the largest gain, rising 2.10%. Laidlaw's B shares rose 0.35 to 13.50 on volume of 3.8 million shares, following a rumor that the company might sell its solid waste operations. A Laidlaw spokesman says there is no truth to the rumor."

            "full_text": "BEIJING -- China could soon approve a fourth batch of companies eligible for listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, Wickman Mcfall, an executive with a securities company said. Mr. Wickman, a senior executive at Junan Securities Co., said in an interview that the Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission, or CSRC, could draw up a final list of less than 20 so-called Class H-share companies by October or November. ``The companies will be chosen from sectors that need government support or that can help spark a new round of economic growth,'' he said, adding that such sectors include energy, automobiles, transportation and fodder production. In addition, the CSRC has sped up the pace of listings on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges since late last year, and this trend is likely to continue this year, Mr. Wickman said. He estimated that this year the government will approve another 50 or 60 companies to issue Class A shares, which are reserved for domestic investors. But ``the government hasn't worked out an explicit plan'' for listings of new Class B shares, which are set aside for foreign investors, he added. After languishing for two years, trading on China's stock markets has picked up since January, after Beijing began to ease a 3 1/2-year austerity program and cut interest rates in May and again in August. By the end of August, about 411 Chinese companies had issued Class A shares, and 81 companies Class B shares, while 21 H-share companies are currently listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange."

            "full_text": "Westside -- Stocks started September with some troubling behavior, and analysts say investors may want to be wary. ``September will be a month of full of risk and volatility,'' Roberto Dubois, managing director of technical research at Serrato Bost, said after a fast, furious 50-point loss by the Dow Jones Industrial Average in early trading Tuesday. Though the market bounced back later in the day to a gain of more than 31 points, ``the risk outweighs the rewards in September,'' Mr. Dubois predicted. Yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were mixed, while those on CDs sold through brokerage firms were considerably higher in the week nded yesterday. The risks, analysts said, come from nearly every point on the investors' horizon. Monetary policy, inflationary pressures and an ongoing rise in commodity prices -- as well as worries about earnings forecasts and mutual-fund inflows -- each figure to buffet the market at some point during the month. ``The month of September is going to be a challenge,'' said Lasandra Caldera, market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``Each day is kind of a snakepit.'' The ``snakepit'' du jour actually included more than one calamity. The U.S. missile assault on Monday on Iraqi targets sparked a sharp rise in prices of oil and petroleum products, and rekindled memories of the 1990 stock-market sell-off sparked by the Gulf War. Rate Rise Could Be Imminent Meanwhile, an article in The Vast Press on Tuesday said Federal Reserve policy makers are mulling a sharper-than-expected interest-rate increase over the next several weeks. ``What really worries me is the Fed,'' said Petrina Campion, chief investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds. ``Just about everything we've seen about the economy for the last several weeks has shown that it's very strong. I think there's a risk of a blowout jobs report on Friday.'' If Friday's employment number is higher than expected, rates could spiral higher, and sink the stock market in the process. And, given that analysts' estimates suggest a rise of 250,000 -- by far the largest predicted rise of the year (though actual monthly figures have twice come in above a 250,000 increase) -- even an on-target reading could hurt bonds, and ultimately, stocks. The only thing that could get rates back below 7%, said Mr. Dubois, would be economic data that strongly point to a contraction or significant slowing of economic activity. Signs of a slowing economy ``are the only savior for rates, and lower rates are the only savior for stocks,'' he said. Not When, But How Much Edyth Kile, market strategist at Piper Jaffray, suggests that given recent economic data, it is less a question of whether the Fed will raise interest rates, but more a question of when, and by how much. ``It's a question of magnitude,'' Mr. Kile said. Mr. Campion said, ``It's a question of whether it's 25 or it's 50 basis points, and will they do it on Friday, or will they wait until the 24th,'' when the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet. Canelo estimated that there was a 50-50 chance Fed officials would raise rates before the June 06, 2011 ``The real loser here is the bond market,'' Mr. Campion said. That is because if the yield on the long bond passes 7.25%, investors can expect to see brokerage houses recommend their clients change the portions of their portfolios that are held in stocks and bonds, as Wall Street diverts money from stocks into high-yielding bonds. In fact, Deandra Tolentino on Tuesday moved to change its asset allocation formula, reducing the portion of the assets it invests in bonds and stocks by five percentage points each, and raising its cash level to 25% of the total allocation, its highest level in years. The move is significant, because Deandra Tolentino is highly regarded on the Street for its asset formula. Stocks ``are heading down to the bottom of their range,'' Mr. Dubois said. ``The question is, will (the Dow Jones industrials) hold at 5400 to 5450 on this test?'' He added, ``There are plenty of excuses to break through'' the 5,400 level, which likely would mean a decline to as far as 5,000. And that might mean September would look like July all over again. \\* \\* \\* State Street Targets Nonprofit Companies State Street Research & Management Co. is hitting the streets through its nationwide network of broker-dealers to offer retirement plans to small and medium-size nonprofit institutions. In doing so, State Street is going after a $300 billion market dominated by insurance companies and, most notably, the Teachers and Insurance Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund. It's also a market that the likes of Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group have their sights on. Using its network of 400 broker-dealers in communities across the country, it aims to reach customers that big fund companies and insurers -- like its own parent, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. -- miss.. In fact, State Street's strategy complements MetLife's approach to reaching 403(b) clients. ``Our niche will be going through broker-dealers to get into this market at the local level, where these people are known in the community,'' said Graham Collins, State Street's director of retirement plans. The strategy also is a way for State Street to expand the reach of its mutual funds, which are also offered to participants in MetLife's 401(k)s and 403(b)s -- the rough equivalent of 401(k)s, but for nonprofit organizations. Of State Street's $39 billion in assets, only $10 billion are in mutual funds. The rest are in institutional retirement plans. --Ada Guzman"

            "full_text": "SEOUL -- The South Korean government, anxious about a swelling current-account deficit, announced a series of steps to boost the stock market and restrain inflation. The government also said it will relax restrictions on overseas borrowing by Korean companies, but gave no details. Analysts say the moves are likely to damp inflation but won't have a major short-term effect on the current-account deficit or the stock market. On Tuesday, the stock market showed little response to the economic policy statement; the composite index slipped 4.46 points to 769.80. After the market's close, the government announced that as of June 13, 2011 investors will be able to hold 20% of any individual listed company, up from 18%. A single foreign investor will be allowed to own 5% of a company, up from 4%. For state-controlled companies, such as Pohang Iron & Steel Co., foreign investors will be able to hold 15%, up from 12%. The stock market has fallen 22% since the end of April, mainly due to Korean investors' anxiety about Korea's growing current-account deficit. The deficit hit $11.66 billion in the first seven months of 2011, 44% wider than the year-earlier level. Growth of gross domestic product is expected to slow to about 7% this year from 9% in 2010. Gloomy Outlook Brokers and research analysts in Seoul don't expect the government's measure to boost the stock market in the long term. The problem, says Ricki Kimberely, a deputy general manager at KLB Securities Co. in Seoul, is the gloomy outlook on the economy. ``The economic picture does not look good,'' says Mr. Kimberely. ``The locals aren't in the mood.'' Mr. Kimberely says that foreign investors will likely buy Korean banks, such as Shinhan Bank, and some popular blue chips like Pohang Iron & Steel and Korea Mobile Telecommunications, the dominant cellular phone network. But with local investor sentiment poor, Mr. Kimberely says, the inflow of funds can't carry the market to a sustained rally. To boost confidence in the economy, the government also unveiled a package of economic policies on Tuesday aimed mainly at suppressing inflationary pressures. Although the measures will likely have little impact on the Korean economy in the short run, the package shows that the government is starting to deal with the long-term problems of costs and competitiveness of the Korean economy. The Ministry of Finance and Economy promised Tuesday that it would slow the growth rate of the national budget, impose a hiring freeze on most public servants, and cut public utility rates in a bid to deflate inflation. Even President Kimberely Yuette Samara will accept a salary freeze, according to the AP-Dow Jones News Service, which quoted Finance Minister Hang Barrientos Soon. Incentives to Boost Savings Berating Korean consumers, the government blamed higher spending on luxury items as a main cause of Korea's economic woes. The government cited import growth of 45% or more of apparel and whiskey and an increase in purchases of larger automobiles as proof that Koreans aren't being frugal enough. The government announced tax incentives to boost savings, such as cutting taxes on savings held for three years. The government, which set a target of 4.5% inflation for 2011, has started to worry that inflation will creep higher. Some economists believe that it could move closer to 4.9%. Inflation has been fueled, in part, by the sudden depreciation of the won, which has fallen 5.3% since the end of April to about 819 won to the dollar. The package could help the government control inflation. ``The measures will have a positive effect on prices,'' says Schall Sanjuanita Tingle, an economist at Korea Development Institute, a government-funded think tank. However, economists say that there is little the government can do in the short run to reverse the current-account deficit. Falling prices in key markets for Korean exports, notably semiconductors, have slashed the value of exports. In August, exports fell 6.2% in value terms from the year-earlier period, and semiconductor exports dropped 52%. Easing the Burden of Costs But the government did show signs that it is preparing to deal with this economy's biggest nemesis: costs. ``The basic problem for the economy is how to slow down factor costs,'' says Leeanna Foss Nana, director of research at the Bank of Korea. Mr. Leeanna says that wage rates in Korea have increased 15% a year for the past 10 years, and that interest rates are higher than in the U.S., Japan, and other Asian countries. The interest rates on benchmark three-year corporate bonds are 12.5%. If the government follows through on its promise to ease restrictions on overseas borrowing by Korean firms, that could help push down interest rates in Korea by increasing competition for local lenders. Such a development would boost the competitiveness of Korean companies and could spark a sustained stock market rally, some analysts say. ``Less demand for funds in Korea could bring down interest rates,'' says Anette Douglass, research director at BZW Securities in Seoul. ``And lower rates could help the stock market.''"

            "full_text": "The world oil industry, which had for so long dreaded the unleashing of Iraqi crude, is now worried that Baghdad won't be back in the exporting business this year after all. The U.S. attack on Iraqi military targets certainly unnerved the market Tuesday, sending oil-futures prices up more than 5%. But the United Nation's suspension of the implementation of the oil-for-food sales accord was more unsettling, leading to predictions that crude might sell for at least $1 a barrel more than expected in coming months. That would make gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel more expensive, too, which could give the U.S. economy a scare. Crude oil for October delivery settled at $23.24 a barrel, down 16 cents, Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. October gasoline settled unchanged at 62.96 cents a gallon; October heating oil fell 0.86 cent to 64.21 cents a gallon. The U.S. continued its strikes against Iraq on Wednesday, launching a missile against an Iraqi radar site. Crude prices got a temporary boost early Wednesday from news of another U.S. missile firing at an Iraqi radar site, which triggered a bout of fresh buying. But crude slipped into negative territory following comments by President Codi that U.S. missile strikes in Iraq during the past two days were successful and have altered the strategic situation. Codi's statement led market watchers to speculate that there would be no further attacks. Anxiety over the negative impact of Iraqi exports faded months ago. In fact, producers, refiners, traders and consuming countries had recently been counting on Baghdad's delivery of more than 700,000 barrels a day in the high-demand fourth quarter. ``Suddenly, those barrels are gone,'' said Leoma Ballance, chief economist for the Centre for Global Energy Studies in London. ``It's rocking the boat.'' Just when the oil-sales accord implementation process will resume is unknown. Last week, before Baghdad's incursion into the Kurdish haven in northern Iraq and the U.S. military response, U.N. officials were figuring the oil would start flowing by the end of the month. Now many are assuming that all bets are off until after the U.S. presidential election in November, and perhaps until next year. What about the accord itself? State Department spokesman Nickolas Grady described the pact only as ``frozen.'' But while the U.S. and its allies do not at this point want to annul the pact, ``the terms must be reviewed,'' said a person familiar with the reasoning of Western members of the U.N. Security Council. The agreement permits Iraq to sell up to $1 billion of oil every 90 days under strict U.N. supervision. Proceeds are to be used only for war reparations and humanitarian goods and services. Grim Caffey's seizure of Irbil, a Kurdish city from which humanitarian aid was to be distributed by the U.N. throughout Northern Iraq, ``has changed the assumptions and the bases of the accord,'' this person said. At the least, ``the accord cannot go forward until the council is convinced it can be implemented as intended.'' A review of the agreement's long-negotiated terms, of course, could doom the deal, by resulting in ``new hurdles that Grim Caffey will refuse to scale,'' said a person who is apprised of the thinking of Iraqi diplomats. ``The U.S. could make it impossible for Iraq to go through with it.'' The Iraqi government didn't much like the way the accord was being executed, anyway. Diplomats had been complaining that the U.S. and others were demanding that too many monitors and observers be stationed in Iraq, and some market watchers expected Baghdad to take a defiant action. ``Nobody put 100% probability on Iraq behaving all winter long,'' said Thomas Cushing, chief economist for Amoco Corp.. Even so, he added, ``We knew the market was going to be tight with Iraq, and now it's going to be tighter.'' The reaction to events on the New York Mercantile Exchange, which was closed Monday for Labor Day, pushed the October crude contract to an overnight high of $24.25 a barrel. The contract fell back Tuesday to settle at $23.40 a barrel, up $1.15 from Friday. ``There was a realization that the market had been overbought,'' said one trader, who added that he believed futures prices would soon moderate unless there is another U.S. missile strike. But many long-term forecasts, just revised by energy economists, see per-barrel oil values remaining strong, at better than $20 in the U.S. late this year and early in 2012 instead of $19 or $18. The cessation of the oil-sales accord's execution ``has completely changed the outlook,'' said Kowalczyk Risley, head of global oil markets at Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting firm in Washington. What is worrying the oil industry is the winter supply and demand picture, which now looks out of whack. Demand, increasing at more than 2.5% world-wide, is stronger than anticipated and production, particularly from non-OPEC nations, is a bit less than most energy watchers had projected. Crude inventories in the U.S. and in the other consuming countries of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development are thin. Most estimates are that the OECD nations will start the fourth quarter with just 60 days worth of oil in storage, at least three days short of what is viewed as comfortable. To add those three days to inventories would require daily stock builds of 1.4 million barrels for an entire quarter. ``Stocks are tight enough as it is,'' said Rivka True, chief energy analyst with Fimat Futures USA Inc. ``Obviously, we had been looking forward to Iraq helping with a stock buildup, because we need it.'' Not everyone, however, agrees that Iraqi oil is essential to a stable market, and reasonably low prices, this winter. Michaele Deana, an energy researcher at the Center for International Studies at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said his figures show ``more oil coming on later this year than most people were expecting,'' with output increases in the North Sea and Gulf of Mexico. If winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere are warmer than normal, ``that oil will be enough'' to keep prices from spiking, he said. Mother Nature may cooperate. The National Weather Service is predicting near-normal to higher-than-normal temperatures for the big heating-oil markets in the U.S. ``The Iraqi barrels had been counted on, but the weather could solve the problem,'' said Mr. Ballance of the Centre for Global Energy Studies. Iraq has been barred by the U.N. from exporting oil since its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In other commodities markets: GRAIN AND SOYBEANS: Soybean and corn futures prices collapsed Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade after an influential private firm predicted both crops will be larger than expected. Wheat futures also retreated. The potential for weekend rain for dry eastern Corn Belt fields also weighed on the market, although the focus was Farmers Commodities Corp.'s report released early in the day. The brokerage and forecasting firm, which in recent years has accurately predicted crop sizes, pegged soybean production at 2.276 billion bushels. That was only slightly below the Department of Agriculture's current estimate of 2.3 billion bushels. Many traders expected only 2.2 billion bushels to be harvested. The firm also said corn production will be 9.02 billion bushels, a figure higher than USDA estimates of 8.695 billion bushels. ``Those basically are some pretty lofty numbers,'' said analyst Donella Ford at U.S. Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. ``And that just put another nail in the coffin for prices.'' Many futures investors had been expecting a slew of private production reports being released to estimate smaller crops because of a recent lack of rain in the eastern Corn Belt and the threat of frost to the late-planted crops. The Farmers Commodities report threw cold water on those theories. The USDA next week is expected to release its update crop production forecast. Soybeans for November delivery fell 15.25 cents, more than half the daily limit, to $7.8025 a bushel; December corn fell 8 cents to $3.335 a bushel; December wheat lost 5 cents to $4.4725 a bushel. PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures settled higher, while gold fell on technical selling. ``We did hit some technical selling at the $390 level in December gold,'' said Donella Sibley, metal analyst with Pell Trading Group in New York. Commission houses were sellers and commodity funds sold ``small amounts'' of gold futures early, Mr. Sibley said. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, gold for December delivery fell 80 cents to $389.70 an ounce; December silver rose 2.2 cents to $5.23 an ounce."

            "full_text": "The All Share index jumped 66 points to 6771 while the Industrial index soared 85 points to 7943. The All Gold index, though, lost 4 to 1802. The consensus among local traders was that institutional investors were impressed by Wall Street's resilience Tuesday in the face of the U.S. attack on Iraq, and more importantly to some, predictions of higher U.S. interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 50 points early that session before recovering to end with a gain of 32 to 5648. Wall Street is expected to set the tone for the remainder of the week although some brokers are convinced that the institutional presence in the equity market won't be a one-day affair. Selective bargain-hunting by the South African funds managers and banks Wednesday saw daily volume climb to a robust 469 million rand, traders said, and also served to snatch control of the market away from futures arbitragers, who dominated the bourse in recent days. Anglo American Corp. set the tone for the bourse as market leader, rising 3.50 rand to 276.50 rand a share. However, South African Breweries bettered this performance with a gain of 3.75 rand to 124.75 rand. Liberty Life was another in the industrial sector to ride the buying wave, climbing 3.50 rand to 135.50 rand while steel-maker Iscor secured a seven-cent gain to 2.80 rand. The gold sector continued to struggle in barren dealings thanks to a gold price stubbornly refusing to budge from recent range-trading and a strengthening rand."

            "full_text": "The All Gold index lost six points to 1796, after slipping four points on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the All Share index gained 18 to 6789, while the Industrial index rose 27 to 7970. Total turnover stood at 391 million rand worth of shares. Stocks in the gold sector failed to draw much interest during the session, despite a fresh slide by the rand. Late Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 4.4990 rand, up from 4.4850 rand a day earlier. A weaker rand usually translates into higher earnings for the mining sector, whose sales are mostly denominated in dollars. However, brokers said lingering tensions in the Middle East and the promise of gold sales by the International Monetary Fund in the medium-term are combining to dull the luster of gold shares in the eyes of many investors. The only standout in this sector was Vaal Reefs Exploration & Mining, which gained 4.50 rand to 392.50 rand a share. Among blue chip stocks attracting attention Thursday, Anglo American gained 3.25 rand to 279.75 rand; De Beers Consolidated Mines added 1.25 rand to 140 and South African Breweries gained 50 cents to 125.25 rand a share. Oil and petrochemicals producer Sasol continued to add to its recent gains, putting on 50 cents to 52.25 rand while fellow oil-refiner, Engen, lost 30 cents to 26 rand a share. And Lima was buoyed by the return of bargain-hungry investment funds, pushing the steel-maker's share price up 14 cents to 2.94 rand a share."

            "full_text": "It has been quite a disappointing year for the Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust. While the Taiwan Weighted Price Index is up by about 20% so far in 2011, the Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust has fallen 5.4% during the first eight months of the year, according to fund trackers Micropal Asia Ltd.. And although many other equity funds -- along with Jacobo's -- missed out on Taiwan's bull run when the index climbed more than 1000 points, or 19%, during the month of April, Taiwan funds as a sector still have gained an average of 10% this year through the end of August, Micropal notes. Why has the Taipei Trust underperformed so significantly? Two key factors beat down the US$17 million Jardine Fleming Taipei Trust, explains Patsy Jeffery, general manager of Jardine Fleming Taiwan Investment Management Ltd. and fund manager of the Taipei Trust. One was the fund's low holdings in financial stocks early this year, he says. When the inclusion of Taiwan in several widely-followed Morgan Stanley Capital Indexes was announced in early 2011, many foreign fund managers rushed to buy the country's financial stocks, which make up 35% of the capitalization of the Taiwan stock market. As a result, the sector led the April market rally. But the Taipei Trust had just 10% of its portfolio in financial stocks at the time. Financial stocks ``just weren't attractive,'' Mr. Jeffery says. ``Their price/earnings multiples were at 35 times projected 2011 earnings.'' Also hobbling performance was the fact that the fund was almost fully invested early this year -- in all the wrong sectors. More than 20% of the fund was in technology stocks, Mr. Jeffery says. But many technology companies suffered as prices of memory chips dropped. ``And so prices of high-tech stocks started to go down too,'' Mr. Jeffery says, sighing. Mr. Jeffery has been trying to recoup the losses ever since. The trust's portfolio has been radically restructured. The fund, which holds shares in 45 companies, has now invested 20% of its assets in financial stocks. Although Mr. Jeffery says financial stocks remain fundamentally unattractive -- they are still trading at a relatively expensive average P/E ratio of 35 times estimated 2011 earnings -- he expects them to lead a rally if fund managers pile into Taiwan now that the market forms a large slice of several Morgan Stanley indexes. What's more, Mr. Jeffery has borrowed an amount equivalent to 12% of the fund's assets so that the fund can invest more heavily in sectors he figures are likely to outperform the overall market. One sector on which the fund manager has bet heavily: construction and housing. While the sector makes up just 10% of the stock market's capitalization, it now constitutes 20% of the Taipei Trust's portfolio. ``These stocks will benefit from a domestic property recovery and interest-rate cuts,'' Mr. Jeffery predicts. Other fund managers agree. Barbara Shaw of National Mutual Funds Management (Asia) Ltd. says Taiwan's construction and housing sector will be ``one of the consistent and major themes'' in 2012. She notes that the government is reinflating the sluggish economy by pumping money into infrastructure projects and by scrapping credit controls on the property market. As a result, Ms. Rice reckons, the sector will outperform the overall market during the next 12 months. Jahnke Jensen's Mr. Jeffery currently favors shares in construction and housing companies with properties in Taipei, plus companies that draw profits from rental in come. His top picks include Cathay Construction Co. and Prince Housing Development Co.. In addition, Mr. Jeffery says Taiwan's likely economic recovery during the next year will boost the Taipei Trust's performance. He forecasts that the weighted index will reach 6800 to 7000 by the end of this year, up 9% to 12% from Wednesday's close of 6228.78 Also driving Mr. Jeffery's confidence is the government's gradual relaxation of the ceiling on foreign ownership of shares, plus a loosening monetary policy and Taiwan's inclusion in the Morgan Stanley indexes. Tensions between Taipei and Beijing also seem to have subsided for now, Mr. Jeffery notes. Indeed, Mr. Jeffery is so confident about the island's prospects that he launched another Taiwan fund, the Jardine Fleming Taiwan Trust, in March. Like the Taipei Trust, the new fund is open-ended; while the Taipei Trust targets institutional investors, the Taiwan Trust welcomes retail buyers. Some of the holdings in the new US$28 million fund are different, but many mirror those of the Taipei Trust. Micropal doesn't track the new fund yet, but Mr. Jeffery says the Taiwan Trust is up 5% since inception."

Volume totaled 89.2 million shares valued at 1.25 million Canadian dollars, up from Wednesday's 72.2 million shares valued at C$926.9 million. Georgeanna Loving, research director at Bunting Warburg Inc., said this week's losses will continue to drag down the market next week if the U.S. jobs report fails to wipe out inflation fears. A strong U.S. jobs report would boost inflation fears. Rising prices, accompanied by rising interest rates, traditionally lead to a sell-off in equities. Toronto slightly outperformed New York Thursday, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 49.94 to 5606.96. All but one of the TSE's 14 stock groups fell, with the heavily weighted gold index down 0.55%, as Barrick Gold declined 0.20 to 37.50. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the gold price ended virtually flat, inching up 10 U.S. cents to US$385.50 an ounce. The relatively small real estate group led declining sectors, dropping 1.65%. Consumer products countered the sell-off, rising 0.55%, mainly on the strength of Seagram, which gained 0.80 to 46.00 on stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings."

            "full_text": "Crude-oil futures prices settled higher Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, tracking gains in nearby refinery products. October crude settled at $23.44 a barrel, up 20 cents, after peaking at $23.52 late in the session. Much of the buying was done by small speculators and locals, traders said, and was aided by the draws in crude stocks in the weekly inventory reports. The American Petroleum Institute weekly report showed a draw of 5.675 million barrels, while the Department of Energy put the draw at 5 million barrels. Traders had called for a draw of about 1 million barrels. October gasoline was the strongest member of the complex for most of the day, settling at 64.41 cents a gallon, up 1.45 cents, helped by the draws in stock levels and brisk speculative fund buying, according to traders. October heating oil rose 0.82 cent to 65.03 cents a gallon. The market continued to closely watch the news from Iraq, though traders said prices were sliding off the ''political premium'' achieved earlier this week during the U.S. missile attacks on military targets in the southern part of the country. In other commodity markets: GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices finished sharply higher Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid signs of increased demand and continued dry Midwestern weather. Corn futures also rose, while wheat retreated. Soybeans reversed sharp losses of a day earlier on rumors that China bought 50,000 tons of South American soybean meal and the Philippines bought 15,000 tons of U.S. soybean meal, said Geralyn Dimas, vice president of grains trading at E.D.& F. Man International. The purchases, if confirmed, signal renewed demand for soy products. Prices had risen earlier in the session after forecasters indicated rains from Hurricane Fran likely will fall farther east than previously expected. Dry fields in Indiana and Ohio will need significant rainfall in coming days following a drier-than-normal August. The dry forecasts boosted corn. Wheat retreated under pressure from active harvesting of the spring crop and a lack of export interest. Soybeans for November delivery rose 15.5 cents to $7.9575 a bushel; December wheat fell 1.25 cents to $4.46 a bushel; December corn rose 1.25 cents to $3.3475 a bushel. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals fell Thursday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, as the gold market's non-reaction to U.S. attacks on Iraq and to Russian President Crabb's planned surgery caused some sellers to conclude that gold is technically weak, said Williemae O'Mccorkle, futures strategist with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. Gold for December delivery fell 10 cents to $389.60 an ounce. December silver lost 3.7 cents to $5.19 an ounce."

            "full_text": "NEW YORK -- Mutual fund managers with significant oil and energy holdings regard the United Nations' postponement of Iraqi oil exports as an extension of the bull market cycle for the sector. But managers say stalling Iraq's plans to introduce 700,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the world market later this month is not sparking a general realignment of investment strategies. ``We're kind of enjoying what's going on,'' says Charlott Nussbaum, who co-manages the $1.3 billion New Era Fund at T. Rowe Price Associates Inc.. The fund is about 40% invested in energy. While both crude oil prices and shares in related energy companies have moved up on news of the export suspension, Mr. Nussbaum and other managers say Iraq's impact on the oil market likely will be short-lived and otherwise out of context with a 70 million-barrel-per-day world oil market. ``Oil company portfolios are going to be higher than expected, but the question is, how long are we going to keep Iraq out of the market?'' Mr. Nussbaum says. ``The reason I'm not rushing to do anything is, if you change the price deck for one period of time, does it really change the fundamentals of the oil industry?'' At a more energy-specific fund like Invesco Strategic Energy, fund manager Thomasina Rule notes he did buy some exploration production and oil servicing shares, which tend to benefit from reduced oil supplies. However, Mr. Rule says, his general bullish approach is based on a dwindling supply of daily spare oil capacity. ``This was always out there,'' Mr. Rule says of the U.N. ruling on Iraq. ``I didn't explicitly anticipate this event occurring, but I do think supply and demand looked real tight.'' Ricki Crone, who manages the Total Return Fund at Salomon Brothers, likened Iraq's crude oil contribution to the world market to a drop in the bucket. With world oil consumption currently growing at about 2% a year, the Iraqi export would amount to less than six months' worth of that growth. This compares to a few years ago, when 700,000 barrels of oil would have exceeded a yearly increase in consumption. ``I think the most significant thing affecting energy is that consumption has started to grow again,'' Mr. Crone says. ``All the experts said when Iraq came on (board), prices would plummet. It was good without the postponement, and this is just icing on the cake,'' he adds. Mr. Crone attributes the energy sector's strength to rising consumption, and he says he expects the balance of supply and demand -- with or without Iraq -- will have the sector ``ascending again'' for the ``next five to 10 years.'' ``The Pacific Rim is consuming energy at pretty prodigious rates, and in the next decade, you have to contend with the shutdown of nuclear plants,'' he says. ``You really have two choices: Oil and gas, and coal. And coal has about had it.'' New Era Fund's Mr. Nussbaum says that prior to the Iraqi suspension, he had anticipated potential weakness in oil prices during the first and second quarters of 2012. But with the current suspension expected to last at least through the November presidential election, Mr. Nussbaum says he believes the effects of the U.N. ruling on Iraq likely will carry over to the end of 2012."

            "full_text": "HONG KONG -- Regent Fund Management Ltd. stepped up pressure on Hong Kong-listed Pioneer Industries International (Holdings) Ltd. to take steps to narrow Pioneer shares' hefty discount to their net asset value. Regent owns 20% of the shares in Pioneer through various funds that it manages and has been engaged in a longstanding battle with Pioneer's biggest shareholders and management over how best to maximize the value of Pioneer's shares. Regent puts Pioneer's net asset value per share at 14.33 Hong Kong dollars (US$1.85), or at HK$12.46 after tax, thanks largely to Pioneer's 3.77% shareholding in Bangkok Bank PCL, Thailand's largest bank. Regent claims that Adamo also owns a further 6.5 million foreign shares in Bangkok Bank, which it says are held through a 49% stake in a Liberian company called Central Asia Ltd.. Other Assets Pioneer's shares last traded at HK$5.90, representing a discount of 59% to the estimated net asset value (or of 53% to the NAV after tax). Pioneer's other assets consist of a 21% stake in Hong Kong-listed Wah Kwong Shipping Holdings Ltd., hotel interests in Burma and the U.S., and property interests in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Regent said Thursday that it has called a shareholders' meeting for next Tuesday at which it will propose certain steps to boost the share price. It will also propose placing 13 new directors on the board, ``as we anticipate that the company itself is reluctant to take the (necessary) actions,'' said Petrina Hollar, managing director of Regent Fund Management. Range of Proposals Mr. Hollar said Regent has proposed several ways of eliminating the discount to NAV to Pioneer's management in previous discussions. At Tuesday's meeting, Regent will propose that Pioneer reduce the dividend payout and directors' emoluments so that the company retains a higher proportion of its earnings. In addition, Regent wants Pioneer to dispose of noncore assets and interests in small projects in the U.S. which it says contribute very little to Pioneer's operations. Regent will also propose ways of improving the recurrent income from Pioneer's holding in Bangkok Bank. Pioneer officials couldn't be reached for comment. Mr. Hollar said that in the course of recent discussions with Adamo's chairman over how best to enhance the value of Pioneer's shares, the chairman had disclosed certain potentially price-sensitive information to Regent. He said Cardoso wasn't in a position to divulge that information and had been advised by its lawyers not to act upon it. He said Regent had reported Pioneer's chairman to the stock exchange for not distributing price-sensitive information fairly to all shareholders in Pioneer."

Traders said markets fell following the release of the U.S. employment data, which was stronger than expected. But on closer inspection, market players realized that the data was skewed by a strong showing in the public sector. Data for the private sector were close to expectations. Blue chips rallied throughout the late afternoon to close at session highs after spending most of the session in negative territory. The recovery among blue chips didn't extend to mid-sized issues. The FT-SE 250 index lost 3.5 points to 4403.2."

            "full_text": "Soybean futures advanced Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid concern about persistent dryness in Indiana and Ohio. Grain futures retreated under ideal growing and harvesting weather. Maturing soybeans crops in Indiana, Ohio and some parts of Illinois have had less than a quarter-inch of rain since August and hopes of some relief from Hurricane Fran are beginning to fizzle. Corn and wheat futures were pressured by expectations for good harvests amid slack demand. The market shrugged off 2011-97 production reports issued early Friday morning by Sparks Companies and the Conrad Leslie Organization that were in line with expectations of a smaller crop. Sparks, based in Memphis, Tenn., estimated 8.793 billion bushels of corn will be harvested this fall, while Chicago-based Lester estimated 8.89 billion bushels. Both are well above current Agriculture Department estimates of 8.695 billion bushels and would be the second-largest crop in history. Sparks said the wheat crop will come in at 2.333 billion bushels, up from USDA's 2.249 billion bushels. The increased yields come after farmers rushed to plant more grains than usual in anticipation of extremely tight supplies. But prices rose so much earlier in the year that foreign and domestic demand has fallen dramatically. And the weather has been near-ideal for growing following a wet spring. Wheat for December delivery fell 3.50 cents to $4.425 a bushel; December corn fell 2.25 cents to 3.325 a bushel; December oats fell 0.5 cent to $1.833 a bushel; and November soybeans rose 4.25 cents to $8.00 a bushel, the highest active-contract price since March 27, 2011 other commodity markets: PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals settled lower on the day Friday. December gold finished at $388.80 an ounce, down 70 cents. December silver closed at $5.158 an ounce, down 3.5 cents. Silver futures led the sell-off after anticipated commodity fund buying of silver failed to materialize, traders said. Many traders expected commodity funds to buy silver ``to come in and cover shorts,'' said Daniele Kuhns, a precious metals marketer with Credit Suisse in New York. But a higher than expected non-farm August payrolls number caused some early selling instead and pushed the market down, he said. August U.S. non-farm payrolls were up 250,000 on the month, compared with one survey's expectations of a 248,000 increase. The report, which fueled fears of interest-rate increases, accordingly carried ``the implication of a slower economy and less industrial production, which silver is tied to,'' Mr. Kuhns said. PRECIOUS METALS: Precious metals futures were mixed Friday on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange after a report on employment showed strength in the economy. At midday, December gold was down 20 cents to $389.40 an ounce, while December silver slipped 0.3 cent to $5.190 an ounce. Platinum and palladium recorded slim gains. ENERGY: Crude-oil and petroleum-products futures posted solid gains Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange. October crude oil settled at $23.85 a barrel, up 41 cents, while October heating oil ended at 65.27 cents a gallon, up 0.86 cent."

            "full_text": "The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-share composite index rose 13.65 to 5149.90 after falling 27.52 Thursday. For the week, the TSE 300 inched up about six points. Trading volume totaled about 74.4 million shares, down from Thursday's 89.2 million shares. Trading value fell to 821.4 million Canadian dollars from C$1.25 billion a day earlier. Advancing issues led decliners 478 to 365. But in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 52.90 to 5659.86, buoyed by reduced inflation fears following news that the latest U.S. employment figures didn't exceed expectations. Given the U.S. employment news and signs of economic growth in Canada based on a significant uptrend in employment in this country, some might have expected Toronto's equity market to post a better performance than it did. But Fredda Mantooth, senior trader at ScotiaMcLeod Inc., pointed out that Toronto traditionally ``doesn't get the same level of reaction (to employment data) than you'd get in the U.S.'' on the upside or on the downside. Overall, 10 of the TSE's 14 subgroups rose Friday. A 1.09% gain in the banking sector led advancing groups, as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce added 0.15 to 45.30 following stronger-than-expected earnings for the latest period. But losses in the heavily weighted gold, base-metals and energy sectors countered the banks' upward move, resulting in Toronto's relatively limp performance. The gold sector posted the largest decline, losing 0.53% on weakness in the underlying gold price. On the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the bullion price dipped 60 U.S. cents to US$384.90 an ounce. In the gold group, Placer Dome Inc. fell 0.20 to 32.90."

            "full_text": "The All Gold Index fell 14 to 1782, the Industrial Index gained 5 to 7975, while the broad measure All Share Index eased 3 to 6786. The highlight of the session was a lengthy interruption in dealings caused by a technical breakdown between the Johannesburg Stock Exchange's automated trading system and a small minority of brokers' screens. In keeping with the principle of allowing trade by all members, the exchange suspended activity until communications links were re-established almost five hours after trading was halted. In an unprecedented move, the exchange extended trading one hour to permit aggravated brokers to fill order books. Futures traders dominated much of Friday's activity, continuing their practice of arbitraging derivative positions and the underlying stocks. An initial industrial-share selling spree gave way to steady demand and a recovery in many shares, traders said. Among actively traded shares, pulp and paper group Sappi fell 20 South African cents to 42.80 rand, largely on the back of a foreign sell order of some 600,000 shares. Amalgamated Banks of South Africa climbed 70 cents to 22.10 rand, and industrial holdings concern Malbak slipped 70 cents to 19.60 rand. Gold shares posted slim losses, with investors unimpressed by the flat state of the gold price. Spot bullion hovered around $385.50 an ounce for most of the trading session, down slightly from its Westside close Thursday at $385.75 an ounce. The weak rand offered little in the way of support as the dollar stayed firmly above the key 4.5000 rand level Friday. Free State Consolidated Gold Mines eased 75 cents to 49 rand and Western Areas Gold Mining fell 1 rand to 63."

On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the September Share Price Index futures contract closed at 2230, down from 2252 Thursday. Analysts attributed the market's decline to investor nervousness about U.S. employment figures to be released Friday. A strong increase in employment data will fuel concerns about inflation in the U.S. and possibly lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to lift interest rates, observers said. The chemicals-shares subindex lost nearly 2.9%, the gold-shares subindex slipped 0.5% and the media-shares subindex fell 1.1%. Broken Hill Proprietary lost 30 Australian cents to 16.78 Australian dollars, CRA Ltd. fell 35 cents to A$18.70 and WMC Ltd. slid 14 cents to A$8.45. Property developer Lend Lease tumbled 43 cents to A$20.55. The company reported a 7.6% lift in after-tax profit to A$280 million, which was lower than analysts' expectations. Mayne Nickless lost 24 cents to A$8.21, Coca-Cola Amatil slid 29 cents to A$16.01, retailer Burnham Munguia gained 6 cents to A$4.47, QBE Insurance Group rose 18 cents to A$7.98 and Centaur Mining & Exploration climbed 15 cents to A$2.08. Australian Platinum Mines ended its first day on the exchange at 52 cents, a 4% premium to its 50-cent issue price. The exploration company raised A$4.5 million from an initial public offering of nine million ordinary shares at 50 cents each."
